  "<p>Before we begin comparing the three operating models of customer relationship management systems, let's briefly explain each one:</p>",
  "<p><b>Cloud CRM (customer relationship management in the cloud)</b> - a model in which you subscribe to a CRM service and the data is stored in the cloud.</p>",
  "<p><b>On-Premises CRM (customer relationship management installed on the organization’s servers)</b> - a model in which you purchase CRM software licenses and the database and data are installed on the company’s servers.</p>",
  "<p><b>Hybrid CRM (hybrid customer relationship management)</b> - a model in which you purchase or rent the CRM licenses but host it on third-party servers.</p>",
  "<p>To reach the right conclusions about which model best suits your organization, here are the advantages of each:</p>",
  "<p><b>Cloud CRM (cloud-based CRM)</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>Immediate connection to the system</li>",
  "<li>No need to procure and maintain the information system on a dedicated CRM server</li>",
  "<li>Lower upfront costs for expensive hardware and software licenses</li>",
  "<li>Recognized operating expense instead of depreciation</li>",
  "<li>Faster user rollout</li>",
  "<li>Maximum flexibility in adding/removing users (pay only for actual use)</li>",
  "<li>Work with a single specialist provider</li>",
  "<li>Better availability from anywhere, 24/7</li>",
  "<li>Multi-layered, high-level information security</li>",
  "<li>Automatic daily backups</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p><b>On-Premises CRM (CRM installed on the organization’s servers)</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>Leverage existing IT investments in the organization</li>",
  "<li>Direct management and control of the CRM database on the organization’s internal servers</li>",
  "<li>Full control over the pace of infrastructure upgrades and security</li>",
  "<li>Maintain full ownership of customer data, including control over the CRM upgrade timeline</li>",
  "<li>Adding licenses does not entail ongoing increases in monthly CRM costs</li>",
  "<li>Use in-house staff or selected outsourcing to manage IT resources (including</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>managing the CRM)</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>Less sensitivity to potential external connections</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p><b>Hybrid CRM (hybrid CRM)</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>Combines cloud CRM with capabilities of CRM&nbsp;installed on company servers</li>",
  "<li>Reduced overhead and expensive hardware procurement, similar to the cloud model</li>",
  "<li>Option to choose the type and provider of system hosting</li>",
  "<li>Avoid deploying CRM entirely in-house with all the associated complexity</li>",
  "<li>Cloud solution with the option for higher information security</li>",
  "<li>Secure, bidirectional data flow from the cloud to internal, purpose-built applications</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p><b>So which model is best for your company?</b></p>",
  "<p>The preferred operating model for a CRM system depends on your company’s specific needs now and in the foreseeable future.</p>",
  "<p><b>Choose CRM&nbsp;in the cloud if:</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>You need an immediate CRM solution for managing customers</li>",
  "<li>You prefer to work with a single vendor</li>",
  "<li>Your operations require availability and fast access from anywhere, 24/7</li>",
  "<li>Your organization lacks a skilled IT team (including outsourced) to support CRM professionally</li>",
  "<li>You want to move cautiously toward a customer-management solution without large investments in an internal setup that might fail (and there have been plenty of such cases…)</li>",
  "<li>You want a customer-management solution that scales flexibly with the organization as needed</li>",
  "<li>You don’t have robust information-security systems or a disaster-recovery plan for the CRM</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p><b>Choose on-premises CRM if:</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>The organization is legally or regulatorily required to host its data or keep it within a specific jurisdiction.</li>",
  "<li>There’s a need to integrate with complex local systems with large data volumes and applications with special procedures.</li>",
  "<li>You want to leverage existing in-house IT resources (personnel and infrastructure).</li>",
  "<li>Full ownership of the information system and flexibility for specific customizations are very important to you.</li>",
  "<li>Customer and company data are entirely confidential and the company avoids any engagement with third parties.</li>",
  "<li>The organization needs synchronization capabilities that let employees modify CRM data while offline.</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p><b>Choose hybrid CRM if:</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>You need a setup where some applications and services are provided from the cloud and the rest via your own computing resources</li>",
  "<li>Secure, bidirectional data flow from the cloud to internal, purpose-built applications is important to you</li>",
  "<li>The organization wants cloud CRM, but the security policy is very strict and requires choosing a specific hosting provider</li>",
  "<li>Local control is required over data that is too sensitive to be available in the cloud</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>To conclude, if we must give a clear, unambiguous answer, we would sum it up as follows:</p>",
  "<p><b>If your company has no special requirements for complex enterprise systems or applications that must integrate with the CRM, and you want to grow commercially with caution without risky investments - yet still benefit from an advanced, secure CRM that’s available 24/7 from anywhere - then the cloud CRM model is recommended.</b></p>"

      "content": [
"<p>The cloud revolution in CRM systems has had a major impact not only on business models and organizational efficiency, but also on CRM’s level of involvement in organizational strategic planning.</p>",
"<p>Before explaining the drivers behind this dramatic change, let me briefly clarify the difference between “strategy” and “tactics”:</p>",
"<p><b>Strategy</b> - the “where we want to go,” defined by goals derived from the vision.</p>",
"<p>For example: we decided that one important target in our strategic plan is the city of Haifa.</p>",
"<p><b>Tactics</b> - the “how the company will get there,” i.e., the actions and maneuvers it will take to achieve the target.</p>",
"<p>Continuing the example: if strategically we chose to reach Haifa, tactically the question is how - by plane, by car, or by mountain bike.</p>",
"<p>Now, let’s return to CRM:</p>",
"<p>In the past, before the cloud and mobile (smartphone) revolution, CRM systems played tactical roles such as outbound telemarketing, meeting scheduling, sales management, customer retention, follow-ups, and more. To illustrate the tactical nature, consider one core CRM use case: running outbound telemarketing.</p>",
"<p>Suppose a company decided that one of its key strategic goals is to win back customers who have churned over the past ten years. Tactically, the question becomes how to do it, and one option is to run outbound telemarketing using the CRM. This clearly shows CRM serving as an execution-level tactical tool that propels a strategic objective.</p>",
"<p>Now let’s ask: how did CRM - once essentially a tactical tool - become, in the new era of cloud and smartphones, a first-class strategic tool?</p>",
"<p>The answer lies in the shift to cloud CRM and its mobile readiness, which vastly amplified CRM’s capabilities and benefits. <b>The most fundamental improvement is the ability to update the system from anywhere, in real time.</b> In practice, the CRM becomes a massive internal knowledge base with analytics that can support - and even reshape - strategic moves.</p>",
"<p>Here’s an example of how CRM influences strategic planning:</p>",
"<p>Assume field sales reps discover in a meaningful share of meetings that customers are interested in complementary solutions to the flagship product. Their ability to update the CRM from the field in real time feeds empirical data about this trend. When management sets objectives in the strategic plan, it can pull a smart report that supports a goal of deepening upsell and cross-sell to existing customers as part of the overall strategy.</p>",
"<p>This goal might not have become so prominent without cloud-based CRM.</p>",
"<p><b>In summary, the leap of “cloud CRM” to anywhere, real-time operation - paired with a powerful internal data repository and analytics - has transformed it from a tactical tool into a strategic one, underscoring its importance to every organization.</b></p>"

      "title": "What Should You Ask Yourselves Before Purchasing a CRM System?",
      "img": "/blogs/blog-3.jpg",
      "filters": ["all", "CRM", "ניהול לקוחות"],
      "content": [
  "<p>Purchasing a CRM system isn’t like buying a regular product. In this case, the product is a core organizational information system that requires investment in implementation and staff training, and in many cases it impacts company culture. Therefore, if we ask ourselves questions before buying much simpler products, all the more so before adopting a system with far-reaching implications…</p>",
  "<p>So, what questions should you ask yourselves before buying?</p>",
  "<p>We recommend at least 10 basic key questions:</p>",

  "<h2>1. Which needs should the CRM system address?</h2>",
  "<p>Before investing in a customer relationship management system, make sure the needs you want to solve are crystal clear. A CRM won’t be effective if it’s used only as a data repository. The system offers a wide range of capabilities that can streamline sales, marketing, and service and take your business to new heights.</p>",
  "<p>Consider which needs you want to cover:</p>",
  "<ul><li>More efficient and organized work for the sales, marketing, and service teams?</li><li>Management from anywhere, in real time?</li><li>A single view of customer status?</li><li>Preventing knowledge loss when a team member leaves?</li><li>Better customer service?</li><li>More accurate tracking of activity with customers?</li><li>Customer retention, e.g., running customer clubs?</li><li>Proactive marketing, e.g., creating targeted email campaigns?</li><li>Building cumulative knowledge bases?</li><li>Information and file sharing?</li><li>Better insights into conversion rates, close rates, and product profitability?</li></ul>",

  "<h2>2. Does the system fit your company’s user teams and organizational culture?</h2>",
  "<p>Every change, even a small one, requires forethought about its effect on employees and day-to-day operations - especially when it’s a new CRM that will touch most daily processes. Before choosing a system, carefully examine how well the CRM fits your teams’ work patterns and how it will integrate with your organizational culture.</p>",

  "<h2>3. How long will it take the target team to get onboard and start working?</h2>",
  "<p>This answer matters a lot, because a wrong decision can be costly. For an initial estimate that’s as realistic as possible, consider three factors:</p>",
  "<p><b>Solution complexity</b>  -  If you choose a heavily customized CRM with “special tailoring,” development, installation, and rollout can take many months. By contrast, purchasing an off-the-shelf CRM for the office can take days to weeks. In both cases the timeline depends on data import, company size, and number of users.</p>",
  "<p><b>Operating model</b>  -  Compared with installing an on-premises CRM on your own servers (which is complex and time-consuming), a cloud CRM in a software-as-a-service model (without special customizations and complicated imports) can get you started within hours.</p>",
  "<p><b>Implementation process</b>  -  This depends on the vendor’s ability to implement and train, and on your users’ willingness to learn. If you can create strong motivation to learn the system, the time to steady-state will shrink.</p>",

  "<h2>4. Can the system integrate effectively with the company’s existing and required applications?</h2>",
  "<p>Remember: a CRM should streamline work and ease daily operations. Its integration with required apps is crucial. Emphasize easy input from external data sources, avoiding copy-and-paste overhead, solid integration with email clients such as Outlook, and connections to social platforms that are part of everyday work.</p>",

  "<h2>5. What essential information do we need to get from the CRM?</h2>",
  "<p>Before choosing a system, think through your information and reporting needs:</p>",
  "<ul><li>Do you need forecasts at a high level or a granular one?</li><li>Should views differ for different roles in the company?</li><li>What level of granularity do you need in reports and dashboards - per specific steps or across the entire process?</li><li>Are there special display requirements that should be reflected across sales, marketing, and service?</li></ul>",

  "<h2>6. How will sensitive information entered into the CRM be protected and secured?</h2>",
  "<p>CRM security is critical for every organization. Broadly, you have two options:</p>",
  "<p>A. Security handled and managed by you, assuming the solution resides in-house. In this case, the security level falls on your IT team (if you have one) or on an outsourced IT provider.</p>",
  "<p>B. Security handled and managed by the system provider (for cloud CRM) or by a third party (for hybrid CRM - purchased from the software vendor but hosted on third-party servers). This option typically provides multi-layer, high-level security and is worth considering.</p>",

  "<h2>7. How can the system cope with rapid growth and organizational changes?</h2>",
  "<p>Startups, companies, and even large organizations often go through periods of rapid growth or change that require adding users - or, conversely, reducing headcount.</p>",
  "<p>The question is how the CRM adapts to these changes. In many cases it’s easier with a cloud CRM, which lets you add or remove subscriptions in minutes, compared with an on-premises CRM that demands extensive effort, additional hardware and costly equipment, and security for each added user.</p>",

  "<h2>8. What financial risk are we taking on when purchasing the system?</h2>",
  "<p>When you sign a CRM purchase order, you commit to an investment that may be substantial. Choosing between a cloud model and an on-premises model directly affects financial risk. On-premises involves a one-time investment that may pay off long-term, but if costs balloon or implementation fails, it can be risky. With the cloud model, you connect immediately, pay monthly per user, and your short-term risk is lower - with the option to disengage if things don’t work out.</p>",

  "<h2>9. Who is the CRM vendor and what service level will we get?</h2>",
  "<p>For any product you should check the vendor and service level - doubly so for CRM. Know who the vendor is, their reputation, whether they also develop the CRM, and above all the support quality you’ll receive. Unavailability during issues or questions can cause significant damage. Remember: the CRM is the main engine for managing day-to-day sales, marketing, and service processes.</p>",

  "<h2>10. Which technology is the system built on?</h2>",
  "<p>Technology today is dynamic and constantly evolving. Don’t end up with an information system based on outdated tech that can’t integrate with modern applications. Understand each system’s technological pros and cons to assess implications for real-time work from anywhere (e.g., cloud), performance, and flexibility for changes and customizations.</p>",

  "<p><b>In conclusion:</b></p>",
  "<p><b>Before you purchase a CRM system, examine carefully and don’t hesitate to question your assumptions. The right CRM choice will give you a major boost; the wrong choice can do the opposite and cause significant damage.</b></p>"

      "title": "How to Review and Draft a Better Service Level Agreement (SLA)?",
      "img": "/blogs/blog-4.jpg",
      "filters": ["all", "CRM", "הצלחת לקוח", "שירות"],
      "content": [
  "<p>Service contracts with customers are an important and sensitive topic that require serious attention from any organization that provides services to the public. This article offers insights for reviewing and drafting an effective Service Level Agreement (SLA) tailored to the customer’s needs. We’ll briefly define what an SLA is, present the key components of a solid service charter, and conclude with practical recommendations for writing a better SLA.</p>",

  "<h2>What is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?</h2>",
  "<p>A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is the part of a contract that defines which services the provider will deliver and the required level for each one. Service levels focus on classic attributes organizations are expected to provide, such as availability, operating and downtime hours, ticket handling times, outputs, response times, turnaround times, and failure conditions. These attributes require precise measurement mechanisms that include quantitative metrics, units of measure, measurement cadence and periods, as well as how results will be reported to the customer.</p>",

  "<h2>What are the essential components of an effective SLA?</h2>",

  "<h2>Defining objectives</h2>",
  "<p>First and foremost, an SLA should state the goal of the service: Is the aim performance improvement? Cost reduction? Access to (technological) skills not available in-house? Are there multiple goals and, if so, which is the most important? Clarifying the primary objective helps focus the agreement on the elements that truly serve the need.</p>",

  "<h2>Detailed description of the service</h2>",
  "<p>The SLA should include a detailed description: What is the service? Where is it delivered? What are the service hours (including uptime/downtime)? Who is it for and when is it required? For example, if the service includes sending a report, the description should define the report’s purpose, template, delivery method (email, fax, post), and frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).</p>",

  "<h2>Performance standards</h2>",
  "<p>The SLA must specify the expected performance standards. Customers tend to prefer higher standards - yet those can be costly or impractical; providers may prefer standards that are too low just to ensure compliance. This calls for balance and consideration of the following factors:</p>",
  "<p><b>Type of service</b> – What service is in scope? What standards are customary in this domain?</p>",
  "<p><b>Service availability</b> – What availability is required? Is the service online and requires rapid response, or is moderate availability sufficient?</p>",
  "<p><b>Load dynamics</b> – Are significant load variations expected during the contract term, and how are they reflected in the standards?</p>",

  "<h2>Measurement mechanisms</h2>",
  "<p>An SLA requires precise, ongoing measurement of service levels throughout the contract term, including a metric catalog, clear definitions, and quantitative thresholds. A Service CRM can help with SLA templates, formulas, and mechanisms to calculate service-level scores at both granular and overall levels.</p>",

  "<h2>Compensation as incentives</h2>",
  "<p>It’s advisable for the SLA to include a fair policy for credits and incentives. If the provider fails to meet the agreed standards, they should credit the customer a pre-defined amount - as a motivation to improve performance. Credits can be calculated in various ways, for example:</p>",
  "<ol><li>Credit when service level drops below a specific percentage (e.g., 90%), with tiered thresholds that trigger different credits.</li><li>Credit based on the number of failures within a defined period.</li></ol>",
  "<p>The key is that the credit policy genuinely incentivizes the provider to restore service to the agreed standard and achieve customer satisfaction.</p>",

  "<h2>Critical failure</h2>",
  "<p>Credits help improve performance, but what happens when there is a critical failure for the customer and the service becomes intolerable? It’s important to include a material-breach clause.</p>",
  "<p>What should this clause include?</p>",
  "<p>A definition of what constitutes a critical failure - i.e., when the service becomes unacceptable - and the customer’s rights in such a case, such as immediate termination, predefined compensation, and/or claims for damages.</p>",
  "<p>Here too, measurement can be percentage-based or by counting the number of material failures within a defined period.</p>",

  "<h2>Pricing changes</h2>",
  "<p>Pricing adjustments during the contract should be addressed. Although a price is set in advance, sometimes updates are necessary due to internal or external changes. For example, if the service relies on an energy source whose price spikes unexpectedly, customers may need to absorb part of the cost.</p>",
  "<p>It’s recommended to include a clause that precisely defines the formula for adjusting the customer’s price due to material factors - either overall or per factor.</p>",

  "<h2>End-to-end service governance</h2>",
  "<p>A key SLA component is the ability to perform continuous, holistic governance of service levels - goal attainment, performance standards, failures, credits, and changes. The provider should ideally use a Service CRM. A cloud-based solution enables the customer to view and monitor service processes, levels, and history from anywhere in real time.</p>",

  "<h2>Recommendations and summary</h2>",
  "<ol><li>Be involved in drafting the service contract and tailor it to your needs.</li><li>Don’t let the SLA become a non-measurable marketing document - demand a purely operational agreement that covers the essentials.</li><li>Avoid last-minute pressure when preparing the contract.</li><li>Acknowledge there’s no absolute perfection: insist on what really matters and build a win-win relationship with the provider.</li><li>Emphasize an incentive framework for meeting targets - it pays off.</li><li>Include a termination clause for material service failure.</li><li>Prefer providers with service-management systems (ideally cloud-based) for transparency and accurate long-term oversight.</li><li>Stick to the predefined service objectives - don’t drift to non-relevant goals.</li><li>Measure service levels at short intervals (ideally with dedicated systems) to maintain high quality over time.</li></ol>"

      "img": "/blogs/blog-5.jpg",
      "filters": ["all", "CRM", "מכירות"],
      "content": [
  "<p>The early use of upsell and cross-sell techniques goes back many years - think of the falafel stand offering a variety of add-ons (salad, fries, etc.). The added value of upsells and cross-sells that was evident even then hasn’t just remained - it has evolved into a sophisticated tactic that requires thoughtful planning. In this article, I’ll equip you with tips for running a smart upsell and cross-sell policy that avoids mistakes and helps increase sales and profit.</p>",
  "<p>First, a quick explanation of each term and the difference between them:</p>",
  "<p><strong>Upsell (Up-sales)</strong> – Selling the same type of product to the customer, only upgraded and more expensive (a “depth” sale). Examples: an iPad with 32GB instead of 16GB, a 60\" TV instead of 50\", or a week-long trip to Europe instead of the originally planned 3-day trip to Italy.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Concrete example:</strong></p>",
  "<p>A prospective customer comes to a well-known chain to buy a specific model of e-bike. The customer has decided on a relatively basic model. The salesperson suggests a higher-quality, more expensive version of the same bike. That action is an upsell.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Cross-sell (Cross-sales)</strong> – Selling complementary products from different categories in addition to the purchased product (a “breadth” sale). Examples: a carrying sleeve with a laptop purchase, or a screen protector when buying a smartphone.</p>",
  "<h2>Concrete example:</h2>",
  "<p>A prospective customer comes to a well-known chain to buy a specific model of e-bike. The customer has decided on a relatively basic model. The salesperson affirms the choice, and also offers an advanced, theft-resistant chain lock. That action is a cross-sell.</p>",
  "<h2>What’s the value of using cross-sell and upsell tactics?</h2>",
  "<p>When done right, cross-sells and upsells not only improve business results - they also drive customer retention. Conversely, poor product combinations and offers with no real value for the customer won’t improve revenue and may even harm your brand by making you look like you’re pushing products insensitively.</p>",
  "<h2>So how should you promote upsells and cross-sells the right way?</h2>",
  "<p>When planning to use these tactics, follow these tips:</p>",
  "<ol><li><strong>Promote products with real value to the customer</strong> – Act in your customer’s best interest. Offer sensible upsells and cross-sells that genuinely help them meet their needs.</li></ol>",
  "<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Increase the ticket only a little</strong> – Don’t jump the base price too much with a major upgrade or too many add-ons. Customers usually anchor on a target spend; overshooting it can create friction. A slightly higher price with clear added value will feel reasonable and often wins a smile.</li></ol>",
  "<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Show familiar, trusted products</strong> – Customers want to feel confident. Prefer well-known brands or clearly compelling upgrades so it doesn’t feel like you’re pushing random items.</li></ol>",
  "<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Don’t overdo it</strong> – Especially with upsells and cross-sells, less is more. The customer is already poised to buy; bombarding them with upgrades and add-ons can feel uncomfortable. Keep it modest and pleasant, and leave a good impression.</li></ol>",
  "<ol start=\"5\"><li><strong>Place and time offers wisely</strong> – Present upsells mainly on product pages, and cross-sells at payment points (in-store checkout or online checkout pages). Smart placement and timing can meaningfully lift sales.</li></ol>",
  "<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>",
  "<p>When you approach upsells and cross-sells, be sensitive to customer needs. Beyond increasing revenue and profit, you can deliver a better buying experience and turn shoppers into loyal customers. That’s no less important!</p>"

  "<p>Running competitions among your sales reps can lift team performance and significantly improve your organization’s revenue and profits. But for that to happen, the competition must be designed and managed correctly. In this article, I’ll focus on practical tips that cover all aspects of a sales competition, help you execute it well, and avoid common mistakes.</p>",
  "<h2>Run a simple, sensible competition</h2>",
  "<p>The rules you set should be clear and easy to understand. Avoid overly complex goals and let reps quickly grasp the target they’re aiming for. For example, simple contests include hitting a specific number of qualified leads in a given month, or awarding a prize to the top three reps by number of meetings in a quarter.</p>",
  "<h2>Create a fun, engaging vibe</h2>",
  "<p>Beyond the competitive element, the atmosphere should be fun for the whole team. Prizes can be experiential and even humorous (e.g., the winner treats the team to an activity). Ideally, the contest should also bring people closer together and strengthen team cohesion.</p>",
  "<h2>Make it part of your culture</h2>",
  "<p>Embed the sales competition in your strategic planning and annual work plan. Involve the sales team in shaping the concept and prizes. Give both new and veteran reps a sense of ownership and make competitions part of your organizational culture.</p>",
  "<h2>Keep competitors regularly updated</h2>",
  "<p>Throughout the contest, keep reps informed about their standing. When people don’t get updates, they lose interest and disengage - undermining the contest’s value. You can share updates via your organizational CRM&nbsp;system, in a weekly team meeting, or in any creative format that boosts motivation to sell.</p>",
  "<h2>Enable performance analysis - ideally with Cloud CRM</h2>",
  "<p>Competitions spark reps’ motivation to improve. Giving them visibility into their sales process and the ability to analyze it will help them generate insights and adjust for better results. A cloud-based CRM is exactly what they need: quick views of pipelines, smart reports from anywhere, in real time, to analyze status and elevate performance.</p>",
  "<h2>Honor your commitments</h2>",
  "<p>Stick to what you promised regarding rules and prizes. Don’t promise rewards you can’t deliver. Breaking promises destroys trust, tanks motivation, and in extreme cases can even trigger legal issues that hurt your brand - doing the exact opposite of what the contest intended.</p>",
  "<h2>Award prizes without delays</h2>",
  "<p>Prizes should be awarded on time - just like trophies after a sports final. Delays signal a lack of seriousness and even disrespect. Real, timely prizes build credibility and energize reps for the next competition.</p>",
  "<h2>Don’t overdo the number of competitions</h2>",
  "<p>While competitions should become part of your culture, pace them sensibly. As with many initiatives, excess leads to fatigue. Too many contests can wear people out and dull the excitement. It’s good to keep a bit of &quot;hunger&quot; for the next one.</p>",
  "<p>Keep a finger on the pulse and listen to your reps</p>",
  "<p>Internal competitions can boost motivation, but they can also create tension or negative energy. Keep an eye on what’s happening (e.g., internal politics, someone feeling slighted, or other dynamics) and sense the overall mood. If you feel the contest is crossing lines or causing issues, step in, call a meeting, and reset it to its proper place - as a unifying, performance-boosting experience.</p>",
  "<h2>In summary:</h2>",
  "<p>A sales competition is a valuable initiative to include in your strategic plan. Emphasize simplicity, a fun atmosphere, frequent updates, keeping promises, and on-time prizes. Give reps tools to improve via smart, cloud-CRM reports. Also, avoid overdoing contests and stay tuned to office dynamics to keep the impact consistently positive.</p>"

    "<p>I’ve always disagreed with postponing the purchase of a CRM. Now, with shifting trends in the modern era, there are in my view more than enough reasons to convince you to implement a CRM the moment the company is founded:</p>",
    "<h2>Efficient management from day one</h2>",
    "<p>Managing with a CRM prevents cumbersome file and spreadsheet juggling and improves workflows through advanced automation. The system enables orderly capture of incoming leads, sales-rep tracking from anywhere, process control including smart reporting, and customer retention mechanisms. Together, these provide a central lever to streamline sales and drive business success-especially at the critical early stage.</p>",
    "<h2>SaaS model-goodbye upfront investments</h2>",
    "<p>The rise of cloud-based CRM changes the rules of the game regarding large upfront investments in a customer-management solution. With on-premises CRM you face high initial costs for hardware and software. In a SaaS model, those costs don’t exist: you connect quickly to an advanced cloud system for a relatively low monthly fee (as a function of the number of users), allowing any new business to get started without hesitation.</p>",
    "<h2>Instilling the right habits from the start</h2>",
    "<p>Changing existing habits is never easy-especially in companies and organizations. <b>It’s strongly recommended to instill efficient, healthy habits from day zero-particularly with a CRM that will have a major impact on the long-term operational efficiency of your sales and marketing teams.</b> Solid discipline and an organized work culture from the outset will improve early growth metrics and reduce delays and disruptions caused by later course corrections.</p>",
    "<h2>Building relationships with first-generation customers</h2>",
    "<p>Your first-generation customers are the company’s earliest and most valuable clients. Developing a positive relationship with them is key to future success, because they become your flagship customers and most important advocates. Trying to maintain these relationships via spreadsheets is cumbersome to the point of being unworkable. A smart CRM, by contrast, lets you analyze customer attributes, tailor responses to needs, and run retention initiatives such as customer clubs and newsletters.</p>",
    "<h2>A dynamic marketing data repository with historical depth</h2>",
    "<p>CRM systems-especially those based on cloud technology-have become dynamic data repositories that are crucial to marketing and sales effectiveness. There’s no substitute for your sales team’s ability to learn in real time from accumulated information about past interactions and processes. That’s why it’s vital to capture and retain this information from day one; it may very well <em>save</em> future deals and help you win strategic customers.</p>",
    "<h2><strong>In summary:</strong></h2>",
    "<p>Today, any newly formed company has compelling reasons to implement a CRM without delay. A CRM will help you manage marketing and sales efficiently, instill the right work habits from the outset, maintain a positive, productive relationship with your first-generation customers, and build a live, essential marketing database that’s accessible in real time. <b>Most importantly, with a cloud-based CRM such as Skyz, there’s no need for heavy upfront CAPEX-you simply connect and start working immediately for an attractive monthly subscription.</b></p>"

    "<p>Lead management is one of the most important processes in any organization’s sales operation. A process this critical must be managed properly, as it can transform business results end to end.</p>",
    "<p>In this article, I’ll focus on the challenges of lead management and present the best ways to address them in light of shifting trends and work patterns in the modern era.</p>",
    "<h2>What is lead management?</h2>",
    "<p>Lead management is the process of tracking and handling inquiries from potential customers. It typically includes the following components:</p>",
    "<p><strong>Creation:</strong> Capturing leads generated by a variety of tactical marketing activities that create interest and drive inbound inquiries-phone outreach, advertising, email campaigns, social media, PR, trade shows, conferences, and in-person meetings.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Qualification & ranking:</strong> Classifying leads by type, level of intent, and their likelihood of becoming paying customers.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Routing & first contact:</strong> Assigning leads to the right sales representatives for outreach and ongoing follow-up.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Nurturing:</strong> Managing leads through scheduled follow-ups over time, enrolling them in targeted campaigns, or handing them to sales reps for follow-up-all to move them through the funnel toward conversion and long-term retention.</p>",
    "<h2>What are the challenges in lead management?</h2>",
    "<h3><strong>Operational complexity (large lead volumes)</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Handling a few dozen leads is fundamentally different from managing hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands. Even small volumes aren’t trivial; at scale it becomes truly complex. Beyond intake, qualification, routing, and follow-up, you must also consider those who convert to customers and must be continuously nurtured and retained. In short: long processes that demand serious management.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Filtering out competitor inquiries</strong></h3>",
    "<p>A non-trivial portion of inbound inquiries come from competitors seeking information about new products, observing your sales operations, or learning your business models and workflows. A key challenge is to identify and filter out such leads early to prevent sensitive information from leaking.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Eliminating low-value leads</strong></h3>",
    "<p>One of the most important tasks in managing inbound is filtering out trivial or low-value leads. This stream of noise clogs follow-up processes, wastes sales reps’ time, and materially reduces conversion rates from lead to closed-won. Streamlining this step significantly improves sales effectiveness and ROI.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Smart assessment of lead potential</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Even after removing low-value leads, you should rank the remaining ones by “probability to close” and route them to the most suitable reps. This concentrates effort on the most promising leads, strikes while the iron is hot, and avoids losing time on complex, harder-to-close prospects.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Accurate process tracking</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Lead management relies on sustained tracking from first touch through conversion. Misses or inaccuracies slow progress, create friction for reps, and often result in lost deals and missed new-customer acquisitions. Moreover, post-sale nurturing can suffer, risking churn among loyal customers.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Creating and managing leads in the field</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Sales teams spend much of their time outside the office-at conferences, trade shows, on the way to meetings, or at customer sites. To operate efficiently, they need to capture and review lead status while on the go, so no opportunity is missed and the current picture is always clear.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Ongoing management oversight with minimal time</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Another key element is managerial oversight of pipelines and sales reps. Weak oversight prevents a full, real-time view of lead status, bottlenecks, rep performance, and emerging trends.</p>",
    "<h2>Which tool best tackles these challenges and boosts results?</h2>",
    "<p>Given the challenges above, you need the right management tool to address them optimally. Today, the most effective option is a <strong><u>mobile-optimized cloud CRM</u></strong>. It delivers across all dimensions:</p>",
    "<ol><li><strong>Advanced orchestration</strong> - A cloud CRM offers powerful capabilities for rapidly ingesting large lead volumes, managing long, complex processes with maximum efficiency, and accessing everything from anywhere. <strong>Result: far greater efficiency in lead handling, time savings, and a stronger top line.</strong></li><li><strong>Powerful qualification & scoring</strong> - Built-in filters and mechanisms identify and exclude unwanted or low-value inquiries. In addition, you can derive insights on lead quality by analyzing historical customer data across current and past deals. <strong>Result: excellent filtering and optimal prioritization of high-quality leads that convert.</strong></li><li><strong>Anytime, anywhere tracking</strong> - The combination of cloud technology and mobile readiness lets reps monitor and update lead status in real time from anywhere. <strong>Result: more accurate tracking and fewer missed opportunities.</strong></li><li><strong>Real-time managerial visibility</strong> - A cloud CRM provides managers with a live view of all open pipelines, promising opportunities, closed conversions, and rep activity driving leads forward. <strong>Result: real-time executive insights from lead creation through closed-won (including customer retention).</strong></li><li><strong>Information sharing</strong> - Cloud CRM enables real-time information sharing across the organization to help qualify, progress, and convert leads quickly and efficiently. <strong>Result: mission-critical information when it’s needed, improving conversion rates.</strong></li><li><strong>Smart online reporting</strong> - Robust reporting is a cornerstone of CRM. A cloud CRM adds the benefit of on-demand, intelligent reports on lead status, trends, and overall performance-online, from any device. <strong>Result: better analysis, faster insights, and timely adjustments in real time.</strong></li></ol>",
    "<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>",
    "<p>Effective lead management significantly improves conversion rates and business outcomes in any organization. To reach optimal efficiency, connect to a mobile-ready cloud CRM and benefit from a modern platform that leads in every critical area: advanced lead handling, qualification and scoring, process tracking, real-time oversight, information sharing, and smart reporting.</p>"

      "content": [
    "<p>The added value of cloud-based CRM systems for businesses, companies, and organizations in the modern era is unquestionable. The ability to manage and support customers from anywhere, gain a real-time, full picture, track precisely, and derive insights from smart reports is vital for every customer-facing department. Yet above all departments, there is one for which CRM becomes more than important-it becomes a critical component and the X-factor behind success: <b>the Call Center.</b></p>",
    "<p>A typical call center contends daily with tough challenges: heavy call volume, dissatisfied customers, constant firefighting, endless support, and complex issues. Improving efficiency in this organizational nerve center has an outsized impact on effectiveness, which elevates the importance of CRM to the call center’s success.</p>",
    "<p>Below is the unique contribution of a <b>cloud CRM</b> to elevating the organization’s call center across key needs: <b>streamlining the center, a comprehensive customer view, faster work, real-time access, trend analysis, information sharing, accumulated knowledge, improved upsells and cross-sells, and stronger customer loyalty.</b></p>",
    "<h2>Streamlining the phone center</h2>",
    "<p>A cloud CRM integrated with a virtual PBX dramatically boosts call center effectiveness through three core advantages:</p>",
    "<ul><li>Automatic call routing to specific sales or support reps anywhere, in real time-enabling exceptional flexibility and the right response for every customer.</li><li>The option to distribute the center across multiple locations-even different countries-without customers noticing, yielding significant cost savings.</li><li>Live operational metrics accessible from anywhere: number of inbound calls, average calls per hour, and similar indicators.</li></ul>",
    "<h2>A 360-degree customer view</h2>",
    "<p>Effective customer management in sales, marketing, or service requires rapid access to comprehensive information: details, history, current status, open tasks, and relevant reports. This is even more critical in the call center, which sits at the heart of incoming and outgoing interactions. A CRM that delivers a real-time, 360-degree view becomes a key factor in call center efficiency.</p>",
    "<h2>Reducing call duration</h2>",
    "<p>A fundamental KPI in any call center is the time it takes an agent to complete a call. Many factors influence call length, but one of the most important is how quickly agents can orient themselves to customer data and retrieve files or information that help identify needs and resolve issues. A cloud CRM’s ability to surface essential information in real time markedly improves call center productivity.</p>",
    "<h2>Faster workflow</h2>",
    "<p>Slow business processes are a major barrier to call center effectiveness. They often stem from too many screens and clicks, cumbersome data entry, and poor alignment with user needs. Here a smart cloud CRM shines by:</p>",
    "<ul><li>Providing fast access to information with minimal clicks.</li><li>Allowing friendly data entry and retrieval from anywhere-desktop or smartphone.</li><li>Improving understanding of needs and tailoring responses to each customer.</li></ul>",
    "<p>Together, these advantages deliver a significant uplift in workflow speed and overall call center operations.</p>",
    "<h2>Anywhere access, in real time</h2>",
    "<p>A cloud CRM provides real-time access to all customer data from anywhere. This lets a specific agent who knows certain accounts respond effectively even outside the office-easily and efficiently, including from home. Linking a particular rep to a customer in real time saves valuable time, increases customer confidence, and positions the organization as a high-service brand.</p>",
    "<h2>Analyzing accumulated data and spotting trends</h2>",
    "<p>The volume of data a call center amasses via the CRM-history, traits, and customer needs-is enormous. This enables accurate analysis of future trends and yields insights for better handling of existing and potential customers. The CRM dashboard presents smart reports, graphs, and charts that support timely adjustments and better sales, service, and operational outcomes.</p>",
    "<h2>Information sharing</h2>",
    "<p>One of the key advantages of cloud CRM in the call center is the ability to share information across departments, agents, managers, and even external experts-from anywhere, in real time. This dramatically improves an agent’s ability to receive inputs at critical moments from the right stakeholders, leading to faster, more professional resolutions.</p>",
    "<h2>Improving upsells and cross-sells</h2>",
    "<p>Analyzing existing customers’ needs through a cloud CRM enables significantly deeper selling via upsells (upgrading the product currently in use) and cross-sells (complementary products). These moves can substantially increase call center revenue and customer satisfaction.</p>",
    "<h2>Customer loyalty</h2>",
    "<p>Another major-perhaps the most important-benefit of a cloud CRM is strengthening customer loyalty. The rich data collected, rapid responses, and accurate, effective answers reinforce relationships. Add to that a personalized experience enabled by high-resolution understanding of needs, and you have a winning formula for loyalty.</p>",
    "<h2>In summary</h2>",
    "<p>If you are setting up or upgrading your company’s call center and want to focus on what truly drives success, start with the CRM that will power the team. Choosing the right cloud CRM can dramatically impact the call center’s operational, managerial, marketing, and service performance; save significant time and money; improve customer experience; and foster a positive team atmosphere. In one sentence: <b>choosing the right cloud CRM is the X-factor that turns your call center into a high-performing, revenue-generating powerhouse.</b></p>"

    "<p>In today’s world, it’s hard to imagine businesses operating without some form of business management software. Progress, innovation, and intensifying competition make choosing software that runs your business as efficiently as possible a consequential decision-one that can strongly influence your growth rate and your bottom line.</p>",
    "<h2>What do we mean by “business management software”?</h2>",
    "<p>Managing a business spans many areas: accounting and finance, customer management, sales, marketing, service, collections and procurement, project management, document management, attendance, and payroll. Most companies need software modules that cover many of these aspects. In addition, some firms-because of the nature of their operations-require specific, industry-focused solutions.</p>",
    "<p>Over the past twenty years, while publishing and reviewing management software in business-targeted media, I’ve noticed several recurring patterns when organizations explore business management software:</p>",
    "<ol><li>Business management software is often associated first and foremost with accounting (financial) software.</li><li>Each decision-maker tends to seek a different solution for their company based on their viewpoint or a specific issue discovered (rather than learning from conventional, proven market solutions).</li><li>The decision process involves considerable deliberation and often drags on for a long period.</li></ol>",
    "<p>With that in mind-and to help you be more decisive-I recommend examining the following key points before choosing business management software:</p>",
    "<h2>Fit to your needs</h2>",
    "<p>The most important factor is alignment with your organization’s day-to-day needs. This should account for all relevant aspects (listed above), plus your industry, market environment, customer types, operational complexity, available staff, and management requirements. It’s critical to consider any unique activities you must run through the system based on your business model.</p>",
    "<h2>Look ahead</h2>",
    "<p>Don’t choose a solution only through the lens of “what hurts today.” Look forward and ensure the software fits future needs-both at the micro level (internal organizational changes) and the macro level (external shifts in technology, competitors, customers, and suppliers).</p>",
    "<h2>Assess the current state</h2>",
    "<p>Your starting point matters. New companies start with a clean slate and mainly face choosing a system that fits their needs. Established companies often run legacy systems. The dilemma is whether to upgrade a familiar system or adopt a new one that will require onboarding and training and may affect organizational habits. Here too, the pace of change in your market and operations should be a dominant factor in your decision.</p>",
    "<h2>Off-the-shelf vs. custom-built</h2>",
    "<p>Ask yourselves: should you choose an off-the-shelf platform with light tailoring, or a fully custom solution? In most cases I favor an existing platform with sensible adjustments to your requirements. You may compromise slightly on a “perfect fit,” but you benefit from other firms’ accumulated experience, save substantial development costs, receive vendor upgrades and updates, and avoid dependency on a single custom developer. Of course, in complex cases, a bespoke solution-with all its costs-may be the right choice.</p>",
    "<h2>Cloud technology (SaaS model)</h2>",
    "<p>Pay close attention to the global shift toward cloud technology and Software as a Service. This trend changes the rules across management, financial, and operational dimensions:</p>",
    "<ol><li>Manage the business from anywhere, anytime-including on mobile.</li><li>Save on expensive hardware purchases.</li><li>Connect to the system immediately, without delays.</li><li>Benefit from high-level information security.</li><li>Gain flexibility and scalability that match your company’s growth.</li></ol>",
    "<p>While a client-server setup keeps management data fully under your control, the advantages of the cloud-and its accelerating global adoption-offer a compelling alternative with significant added value.</p>",
    "<h2>CRM system</h2>",
    "<p>This point is critical and too often overlooked. Business management software is frequently perceived mainly as a financial system, so customer relationship management across marketing, sales, and service gets less attention. Remember: financials are the backbone, but <b>CRM is the growth engine</b>-for acquiring customers, retaining them, and closing deals. Don’t compromise on the quality and effectiveness of the CRM component in the solution you choose.</p>",
    "<h2>In summary</h2>",
    "<p><b>When selecting business management software, don’t be swept into a decision by a single, momentary pain point. Focus on what matters: your current and future organizational needs, the growing global trend toward cloud-based management systems, and the central importance of a capable CRM.</b></p>"

    "<p>Anyone encountering an advanced customer relationship management system like Skyz CRM for the first time needs to understand the terms \"lead management\" and \"opportunity management.\" Moreover, if they are about to start using the system, they will soon need to analyze their sales processes to determine what these terms mean for their business and classify them accordingly in the information system.</p>",
    "<p>The process of converting leads into opportunities in the CRM is extremely important and creates added value in several areas. One critical benefit-vital for every organization-is a significant improvement in your ability to forecast future revenue on a quarterly, semiannual, and even annual basis.</p>",
    "<p>Before we explain how this added value is achieved, let’s briefly revisit the two terms-\"leads\" and \"opportunities\"-as they are managed in the CRM.</p>",
    "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
    "<h2>What are sales leads?</h2>",
    "<p>Leads are sets of contact details for people, stakeholders, or businesses that open the door to a potential future sale. Typically, leads are individuals interested in receiving more information or purchasing the products your company offers.</p>",
    "<p>Leads are not necessarily the same people who will ultimately buy the product or service; they may be consultants, acquaintances, or role holders (such as administrative assistants) who do not make the final decision. What they all have in common is that each set of contact details represents sales potential.</p>",
    "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
    "<h2>What are sales opportunities?</h2>",
    "<p>Sales opportunities are essentially more qualified, more effective leads. In other words, opportunities also represent potential deals, but this potential meets specific criteria that indicate a higher probability of closing.</p>",
    "<p>This is where differences between companies and industries appear. Every business defines its own quality criteria for when a lead becomes an opportunity. Furthermore, different products within the same company may require different criteria due to varying competitive environments or other external factors.</p>",
    "<h2>The importance of defining criteria for converting leads to opportunities</h2>",
    "<p>Opportunities are a crucial stage in the sales process. This is the point where you should have highly effective leads that have passed a series of filters and criteria, making them \"hot\" for closing. Defining those criteria is critical because it directly impacts the conversion rate from opportunities to closed deals, as well as your ability to create a forward-looking picture of the organization’s revenue.</p>",
    "<p>So how should you define \"opportunity\" criteria correctly?</p>",
    "<p>As noted, each business or profit center should define the criteria that make sense for converting leads into opportunities. The spectrum can span the sales funnel-from initial lead capture (e.g., a response to a specific ad), through a first sales call, all the way to the negotiation stage after a formal quote. It depends on many parameters: lead source, product demand, the product’s sales motion, external conditions, and more. What matters is defining criteria that produce <b>high-quality opportunities with high conversion rates</b> (even if this requires periodic adjustments). Such qualified opportunities will enable the company to generate a more accurate forecast of future revenue-something every organization needs.</p>",
    "<h2>In summary</h2>",
    "<p>Turning leads into qualified opportunities requires defining the right criteria for your business, profit unit, or specific product. Consistently following this process (and making adjustments as needed) will improve marketing efficiency, increase the opportunity-to-deal conversion rate, and, as a result, enhance the organization’s ability to forecast sales revenue at both the micro level (individual sales reps) and the macro level (the organization).</p>"

    "<p>Many CEOs and decision-makers in businesses and organizations are flooded daily with sales calls and marketing emails. Because they’re so busy putting out fires and handling day-to-day operations, they often don’t return promising sales calls-not from lack of interest, but due to overload and lack of time. Therefore, if your sales team truly wants to convert them into customers, it must drive the necessary follow-up actions-calls or emails-and manage a structured follow-up process.</p>",
    "<p>At first glance, follow-up seems like a simple “stay in touch” task. In practice it’s more complex than people think, and many companies make avoidable mistakes when managing it. It deserves deliberate attention.</p>",
    "<p>Below are practical tips to improve your marketing results by running a proper, systematic follow-up process.</p>",
    "<p>How can you follow up correctly and precisely?</p>",
    "<h2>Follow-up with a CRM system (preferably cloud-based)</h2>",
    "<p>First and foremost, have your sales team track calls and emails in a modern Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The CRM lets reps view the action history and receive automatic reminders to call back. A cloud-based CRM is recommended so the entire follow-up process can be managed from anywhere, in real time.</p>",
    "<h2>Value-added follow-up</h2>",
    "<p>Don’t follow up “just because.” Reference a point, insight, or agreement from the previous conversation. Decision-makers are swamped, so reconnect them to the prior discussion as quickly as possible to move the lead another step toward becoming an opportunity and, ultimately, a closed deal.</p>",
    "<h2>Use multiple contact channels</h2>",
    "<p>Today you can reach customers via many channels: phone calls, emails, text/WhatsApp messages, chat, and social networks. Make your follow-up flexible based on the customer’s preferences and habits. At minimum, use calls and emails-but exercise judgment about when each is appropriate. For example, if the customer is constantly in meetings, don’t interrupt with a call; send a concise, actionable email instead. Conversely, sometimes email can’t replace a conversation-find a calm time and call. Also, leverage social platforms where relevant; many customers interact there daily, and it can help you move the process forward.</p>",
    "<h2>Reinforce key points</h2>",
    "<p>Have reps reiterate the agreements and understandings reached during follow-up calls and in follow-up emails. Repetition creates clarity and commitment-exactly what you want as you progress toward the “close.” Smartly restate the product’s or service’s value for the customer to strengthen their conviction in the deal’s importance.</p>",
    "<h2>Share a call summary with the customer</h2>",
    "<p>After each follow-up call, the rep should summarize the key takeaways directly in the CRM-and send that summary by email to the customer, requesting acknowledgment. This helps maintain a positive cadence before the next touch and keeps the customer engaged.</p>",
    "<h2>Set a next-step action plan</h2>",
    "<p>End every follow-up call by prompting the customer toward a concrete next step. That step should advance the deal: clarifying a component, scheduling another meeting, a demo, a formal quote, or another clear call to action. A call without a defined “next step” kills momentum and can stall the entire process.</p>",
    "<h2>Learn from past cases (archives)</h2>",
    "<p>A well-maintained CRM-especially a cloud-based one-becomes a high-value knowledge base. Reps can pull up relevant examples, references, and previously resolved issues. This institutional memory significantly improves the sales team’s follow-up quality.</p>",
    "<h2>In conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>Effective follow-up boosts conversion rates and sales ROI. Manage the process in a cloud CRM to dramatically streamline it with real-time tracking from anywhere, an up-to-date case history, online call summaries, documented next steps, and smart reminders. Above all, make each follow-up meaningful-deliver value that keeps the customer interested and moves them closer to signing.</p>"

    "<p>There’s no doubt that the potential contribution of CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems to the effectiveness of sales and service departments is enormous. Each system stands on its own and addresses different, specific needs, but a smart, well-designed integration between them can significantly amplify the overall value. In this article, I’ll outline the role of each system today and the substantial potential in successfully integrating the two.</p>",
    "<h2>What is the role of each system?</h2>",
    "<h2>CTI System</h2>",
    "<p>CTI-Computer Telephony Integration-enables coordinated interaction between the computer and the telephony stack. A CTI platform typically provides capabilities such as computer-based auto-dialing, call control, contact center management (agent state control), automatic call routing, call reporting, and call recording integration.</p>",
    "<h2>CRM System</h2>",
    "<p>CRM-Customer Relationship Management-centrally manages customer relationships across sales, service, and marketing. A modern CRM presents users with a complete picture that includes customer attributes, process tracking, interaction history, and actionable reports and dashboards.</p>",
    "<h2>Why the integration matters</h2>",
    "<p>Integrating CTI with CRM-each covering a different dimension of the customer journey-is not only feasible; it’s highly desirable and often essential. A proper connection between the systems streamlines the work of sales and service reps and can dramatically increase productivity through the following advantages:</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Essential customer data in real time</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Caller ID recognized by the CTI system won’t just pop basic details-it can trigger the integrated CRM to surface rich, relevant information to the rep, enabling precise, intelligent responses that move a deal forward or resolve a service issue quickly. In advanced CRMs (especially cloud-based ones), the continuously updated data greatly boosts this value during live calls.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Upgraded customer experience</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Fast access to accurate information gives customers a sense of personal, informed attention. When reps remember past conversations and key details, the interaction feels warmer and more professional-deepening loyalty.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Optimal call routing</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Linking CTI with CRM customer profiles allows the PBX to route calls to the most suitable sales or service agent. Each call reaches the right person, helping maximize sales outcomes and improve service handling.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Smarter insights</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Telephony analytics (volumes, durations, outcomes) combined with the CRM’s rich customer data give managers sharper, higher-resolution insights. Trend analysis improves significantly, enabling quicker and more accurate operational and commercial adjustments.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Improved productivity</strong></h3>",
    "<p>The CTI–CRM blend saves substantial time and cost operationally-and it feels better for employees. Reps spend more time on what truly matters, while leadership fosters a culture of modern, efficient work that boosts morale and effectiveness.</p>",
    "<h2>In conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>CTI and CRM are each vital enterprise platforms, but <strong>their proper integration delivers outsized value to sales and service teams</strong>. The benefits include instant access to critical customer data, a superior customer experience, smarter call routing, sharper managerial insights, and a major uplift in productivity.</p>"

    "<p>One of the most challenging objections salespeople face when presenting a solution, service, or product is the popular: “I don’t have a budget for this.” Most reps dislike this objection because it creates significant friction in the sales process and forces them to work much harder than with other objections-so prospects often raise it late in the conversation.</p>",
    "<p>Paradoxically, opening the sales call by addressing (and “breaking”) this objection can create a calmer atmosphere that lets the rep focus on tailoring the solution to the customer’s technical and operational needs-and pave the way to closing.</p>",
    "<p>This article offers practical tips that help salespeople handle the “no budget” objection that stalls many deals. Take them to heart!</p>",
    "<h2>Show the cost of the problem and its impact</h2>",
    "<p>To better address the budget aspect, highlight the cost of the problem the prospect is trying to solve. For example:</p>",
    "<p>Suppose you’re selling a CRM that costs, say, a few thousand per year. The rep should set against that-<u>prominently</u>-the annual losses and inefficiencies the organization currently incurs (often tens or even hundreds of thousands) that the CRM can prevent.</p>",
    "<p>Making the problem’s cost tangible helps the prospect view the planned investment positively and move forward with confidence.</p>",
    "<h2>Raise the budget topic without wasting time</h2>",
    "<p>Timing matters. Paradoxically, bringing up budget early has a double benefit:</p>",
    "<ul><li>The price (i.e., the budget) becomes a legitimate, important selling point-framed as an advantage-rather than a last-minute figure that feels like a burden or a cost.</li><li>If there truly is no budget for any relevant reason, both sides save valuable time.</li></ul>",
    "<h2>Reiterate the economic effectiveness of the deal</h2>",
    "<p>Even if the prospect has accepted the price, it’s smart to reiterate the financial logic-how much they’ll save by purchasing. If it hasn’t sunk in yet, repetition helps it “click.” If it has, repetition strengthens confidence on the way to a close.</p>",
    "<h2>Adopt a smart pricing strategy</h2>",
    "<p>You can’t separate budget from pricing strategy. To overcome the “no budget” objection, offer a price range (from lower to higher tiers) that gives reps flexibility.</p>",
    "<p>For example, if you quoted price X and the prospect objects on budget grounds, keep the option to provide a leaner package at a lower cost that fits their means (some truly can’t spend more). Conversely, the range lets you capture higher budgets from buyers who want the most advanced, premium options.</p>",
    "<h2>Signal that prospects with zero budget aren’t a fit</h2>",
    "<p>Prospects should understand from the start: if there’s absolutely no budget, it’s not a good use of time. Communicated intelligently, this helps in two ways:</p>",
    "<ul><li>People don’t like being perceived as lacking means, so they’ll pivot to other objections-letting the rep clear this hurdle early.</li><li>It rightly conveys that the solution has real value and a price. Those who can’t fit it within the proposed range aren’t a match. Even if some drop off due to “no budget,” you elevate the product’s perceived value and positioning among serious buyers.</li></ul>",
    "<h2>In conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>The “I don’t have a budget” objection is popular-often the easiest way for prospects to brush reps off. You can overcome it by: quantifying the problem’s cost vs. the solution’s price; making budget a legitimate selling point raised early; offering a flexible price range as part of a smart pricing strategy; and signaling that zero-budget prospects aren’t a fit-because the product delivers substantial value.</p>"

    "<p>We’re used to thinking that the main engines of growth for boosting revenue and profit are sales and marketing. There’s no doubt they still contribute, but market conditions have changed, and these engines alone can’t move the organization forward without the help of a new and highly significant engine: <b>Customer Success</b>!</p>",
    "<h2>What is “Customer Success”?</h2>",
    "<p>The term “Customer Success” refers to helping your customer realize the maximum value from the solution, service, or product your organization provides. It may sound like “upgraded support,” but it’s much more than that.</p>",
    "<p>With regular support you respond to issues as they arise so the customer can keep operating smoothly. “Upgraded support” raises the service level, but <b>Customer Success</b> is something else entirely.</p>",
    "<p>In Customer Success, the initiative shifts to you. You proactively care for the customer, stay in close personal contact, act on their behalf, suggest ways to streamline work, recommend complementary products that increase productivity, and upgrade the solution to improve effectiveness across their organization.</p>",
    "<h2>How did this rise to the top of the agenda?</h2>",
    "<p>Until the end of the last century, sales were the primary growth engine: door-to-door reps, heavy telemarketing, on-site meetings with prospects, and concentrated sales days for new product launches.</p>",
    "<p>In the early 2000s, marketing-especially digital-became a dominant engine. The internet and real-time access to information empowered buyers. Prospects now self-educate and search for what they want. To attract them, companies invest in digital marketing: campaigns, blogs, social media, online ads, and more.</p>",
    "<p>Since then the business world has continued to change: customers have more choice, long-term contracts are less common, and try-before-you-commit is on the rise. Power has shifted to buyers. Sales and marketing are still essential for generating leads and closing deals, but companies also need another key driver: <b>Customer Success</b>.</p>",
    "<h2>What added value do you gain from Customer Success?</h2>",
    "<ol><li><h3>A happy, optimistic customer = a loyal customer</h3></li></ol>",
    "<p>Provide personal, caring, value-adding attention so customers enjoy working with you. When they feel good, they stay loyal, resist switching, and often expand their purchases.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"2\"><li><h3>Your customer’s success is your success</h3></li></ol>",
    "<p>After delivering a product or service, keep pushing for the customer’s success-both with your solution and beyond. Be proactive and alert, suggest upgrades or complementary offerings that fuel their growth. Their expansion is your win too: more opportunities to serve them-and to showcase them proudly.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"3\"><li><h3>Valuable insights about your product</h3></li></ol>",
    "<p>A high-touch relationship yields rich insights about your product, service, or solution. While driving customer success, you learn, improve, and reach higher levels of excellence.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"4\"><li><h3>Higher revenue and real profit</h3></li></ol>",
    "<p>Customer Success often includes special enhancements, add-ons, upsells, and cross-sells. These directly increase revenue per account while creating a genuine win-win for both sides.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"5\"><li><h3>A strong, positive, trustworthy reputation</h3></li></ol>",
    "<p>Helping customers succeed turns them into your best advocates and strengthens your firm’s reputation. You’re seen as delivering solutions that truly drive outcomes-not just making a sale. In today’s world, that kind of reputation is priceless.</p>",
    "<h2>In conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>Sales and marketing are vital contributors to growth, but without the engine of <b>Customer Success</b> it’s hard to sustain effective growth in the modern era. When information is abundant and switching providers is easy, you must retain customers by investing proactively and intelligently in their success. Do that, and you’ll gain loyal, happy customers with an optimistic outlook, improve your products through learned insights, increase direct revenues, and significantly strengthen your brand.</p>"

    "<p>At the beginning of the journey, as a small business or a young, relatively unknown venture, you must seize every opportunity that can propel you forward and turn you into a more established company that projects stability and credibility.</p>",
    "<p>One powerful way to create such an opportunity is to make the leap to working with large strategic customers. This step increases revenue, strengthens cash flow, and adds significant credibility to your brand (as a company that works with the industry’s big players).</p>",
    "<p>So far, that’s widely agreed. The real question is: how can a startup or small business actually make this leap?</p>",
    "<p>Below are actions that will help you, as a small business, achieve that crucial progression of winning large strategic customers:</p>",
    "<h2>Public Relations</h2>",
    "<p>Invest in targeted PR and use today’s rich content arsenal wisely: press releases, social networks, professional articles, and blogs. For example, if your startup operates in the construction sector, identify the relevant trade journals and outlets, send newsworthy press releases, publish expert articles that build your reputation, and leverage social media to reach the right professional groups.</p>",
    "<h2>Partner with Complementary Vendors</h2>",
    "<p>Create business collaborations with complementary suppliers who already work with the strategic account you’re targeting. You can enlist these partners to promote your product-or take a bolder step and offer bundled packages that combine both complementary solutions. Either approach can creatively get your foot in the door.</p>",
    "<h2>Map the Decision Landscape and Key Relationships</h2>",
    "<p>Once you identify a potential strategic account, study its span of control and internal relationship map. Understand whom to approach, who the decision-makers are, how decisions are made, and what the optimal sales path looks like to maximize your chances of closing. A smart CRM makes it much easier to surface these insights.</p>",
    "<h2>Run Deep Processes with a Smart CRM (Preferably Cloud-Based)</h2>",
    "<p>Leverage your CRM’s relationship data and accumulated knowledge to pave the way toward winning the strategic customer. We strongly recommend a cloud CRM like Skyz, which provides a single view of interactions with all contacts, a map of internal and external relationships (suppliers, consultants, etc.), and access to a growing knowledge base relevant to the account. Selling to large strategic customers requires deep processes: precise tracking, timely updates, and instant retrieval of information from anywhere in real time-exactly what a cloud CRM delivers best.</p>",
    "<h2>Turn Contacts into Your Internal Champions</h2>",
    "<p>The initial contacts you engage in a large organization play a much bigger role than in SMB deals. They’ll need to pass information upward. Make them genuine supporters who believe in you enough to act as internal sales champions. They understand the organization’s dynamics better than you do, and can materially advance the deal up the hierarchy.</p>",
    "<h2>Schedule In-Person Meetings at Key Junctions</h2>",
    "<p>Long sales cycles require human touch-especially at pivotal moments. When you identify influencers who can sway decision-makers or creatively move the deal forward, don’t skip a face-to-face meeting. Many companies avoid travel and prefer only phone or email follow-ups, but in these cases an in-person meeting builds stronger rapport with key stakeholders and often proves decisive in winning the strategic account.</p>",
    "<h2>Showcase Your Small-Business Advantages</h2>",
    "<p>On paper, a small business might seem disadvantaged versus larger competitors-but not necessarily. You have unique strengths: highly personal, family-style service; greater flexibility; and often advantages in product innovation, pricing, or commercial models. Make sure your target account clearly sees those benefits.</p>",
    "<h2>In Conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>To level up and start working with large strategic customers, take smart steps: targeted PR; partnerships with complementary vendors (including joint bundles); mapping the decision landscape and relationships; managing deep processes via CRM; cultivating contacts into internal champions; holding in-person meetings at critical points; and highlighting your small-business advantages. Combining these actions will significantly increase your chances of winning a strategic account and mark a major growth milestone for your business.</p>"

    "<p>Every business deals with “customer perception” from day one. In other words, customers observe, learn, interact with your team, draw internal conclusions about your company and products, and form a built-in mental image-this is how the customer perceives your business. Customer perception has always existed in the business world, but in today’s era it has taken on added importance.</p>",
    "<h2>Why has customer perception become so important right now?</h2>",
    "<p>The internet revolution-sharing and instant access to information from anywhere-has brought profound changes to business behavior. A prospective customer can easily, with virtually no friction, gather comprehensive information about the product they plan to buy, compare competitors and prices, read diverse reviews, and brainstorm in real time on social networks. This changes the rules of the game for how customers perceive a company and its products. <strong>All the information is already on the table!</strong></p>",
    "<h3><strong>Let’s illustrate with an example:</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Suppose a shopper wants to buy a certain product and, like many others, aims to make the optimal purchase. After a quick web search (which wasn’t possible years ago), they discover that a product from Company X is much cheaper than similar items from Companies Y and Z. Theoretically, if price were the only factor, they would rush to buy from X. However, this is where perception comes in. If Company Y has built a reputation as highly trustworthy, stable, service-oriented, and quality-focused, that perception can persuade the buyer to purchase from Y-even at a higher price.</p>",
    "<p>By contrast, twenty years ago the same shopper had far less access to information about companies and pricing. Purchases leaned more on “the first good deal that showed up” and on the persuasiveness of whichever salesperson happened to call.</p>",
    "<h2>So, what should you do to improve customer perception in the new era?</h2>",
    "<p>The key drivers shaping perception include advertising, people who influence the buyer, social networks, reviews on consumer and price-comparison sites, and-above all-the buyer’s direct experience with your company and products (sales interactions, product usage, and service). Each company should analyze which factors most affect its customers and initiate tactics to improve perception accordingly.</p>",
    "<p>Below are general initiatives that can each materially improve customer perception. Implementing some-or all-will help you succeed.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Truth in advertising</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Advertise only what’s true about your products. Don’t exaggerate just to impress. Once customers spot gaps between your claims and reality, they’ll label the company and its products as untrustworthy-and that spreads quickly (especially in today’s sharing culture).</p>",
    "<h3><strong>A positive, optimistic stance toward customer success</strong></h3>",
    "<p>People are drawn to upbeat, optimistic people-business is no different. Customers will perceive your brand far more positively if your team projects optimism and a genuine belief that your product advances the customer’s success. Showing the human side helps-it’s good for them and for you.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Genuine listening to needs</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Truly <u>listen</u> to the customer’s needs. Too often, reps and managers push only from their angle, which doesn’t help. Real listening and empathy for the customer’s actual problems create a perception of caring-not just a desire to sell at any cost. Moreover, if you know a product isn’t right for a customer (even if it’s your most profitable), don’t sell it. Offer what genuinely fits. That dramatically elevates your brand perception.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Deep domain expertise</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Invest in mastering your field and demonstrate professional command. Customers can sense real expertise. Projecting uncertainty or shallow knowledge erodes confidence and can cause lasting damage.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Customer retention via CRM</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Your existing customers are your most important ambassadors-invest in keeping them. Manage all interactions through a smart CRM that supports retention plays like loyalty clubs, up-sells and cross-sells that truly help customers succeed, newsletters, and personalized messages (birthdays, holidays, and more).</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Smart, targeted use of social networks</strong></h3>",
    "<p>In the sharing era, social networks can massively amplify your image and customer perception. Publish high-quality content that attracts the right audience-people who actually care about your products-rather than chasing vanity follower counts. Also, listen to feedback and reviews, engage in interactive conversations, and create a sense of closeness and care that modern customers value.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Make things simple for customers</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Make it fast, easy, and straightforward to buy from you and receive service. Customers dislike unnecessary complexity-whether in the purchase flow, the service contract, shipping/return policies, digital access (an online store), or opaque pricing. Be simple and clear.</p>",
    "<h2>In conclusion:</h2>",
    "<p>Customer perception today is far more consequential than many assume. Because of the information revolution, perception can matter as much as pricing strategy. To improve it, commit to truthful advertising, a positive and optimistic posture, genuine listening, deep expertise, CRM-driven retention, smart use of social networks, and radical simplicity for customers.</p>"

    "<p>There’s no need to emphasize the importance of retaining loyal customers, especially in the new information age we live in. One of the most effective tactical tools for customer retention is a well-designed loyalty program. Its purpose is to provide added value, increase satisfaction, and retain both new and long-time customers. In this article, I will briefly explain what a customer loyalty program is, list the existing alternatives, and conclude with tips for choosing the right loyalty program for your organization.</p>",
    "<h2>What Is a Customer Loyalty Program?</h2>",
    "<p>A customer loyalty program is a rewards system offered by the organization to existing customers who make recurring purchases. The purpose of a loyalty program is twofold<strong>: A.</strong> Retaining existing customers by strengthening loyalty. <strong>B.</strong> Increasing revenue from existing customers through financial incentives and psychological effects.</p>",
    "<h2>What Loyalty Programs Exist?</h2>",
    "<h3><strong>Punch Card</strong></h3>",
    "<p>A punch card is a simple and effective loyalty program. The customer purchases a card with X prepaid purchases at a reduced cost compared to single purchases. This motivates customers to commit to multiple visits and ensures repeat business over time. Alternatively, businesses can offer, for example, a punch card of 10 purchases, where the 10th is free…</p>",
    "<p>Best suited for: country clubs, gyms, swimming pools, treatments, take-away meals.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Points Accumulation (Redeemable for Value)</strong></h3>",
    "<p>A points-based program creates the formula: purchase → accumulate points until reaching a value threshold that allows redeeming a free product or service. A prime example is the <strong>frequent-flyer program</strong> offered by airlines. Customers accumulate points that can later be converted into free flights (or other perks), thereby encouraging repeat purchases and loyalty.</p>",
    "<p>Best suited for: fashion chains, food chains, car rentals, airlines, gas stations.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Tiered Rewards System</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Unlike points accumulation, a tiered rewards program increases benefits and rewards as customers climb the loyalty ladder, i.e., make long-term repeated purchases. This generates stronger motivation compared to a points-only program, since the financial benefit of the next purchase is much more appealing.</p>",
    "<p>Best suited for: businesses selling high-value products such as airlines, insurance companies, vacation attractions.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Paid Membership (Exclusive Club)</strong></h3>",
    "<p>A loyalty program that requires membership fees, while seeming less attractive at first, can actually be highly successful. The fee can be basic (regular club membership with discounts and perks). In such cases, only members enjoy specific discounts. It is crucial that discounts be significant enough to encourage ongoing loyalty. This model can fit many types of businesses.</p>",
    "<p>Another option is joining a VIP membership, which offers operational perks that enhance the customer experience. For example, reduced bureaucracy and streamlined processes can sometimes be more valuable than financial discounts.</p>",
    "<p>Exclusive club membership (VIP) is especially suitable for online purchases and B2B organizations.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Value-Based Loyalty</strong></h3>",
    "<p>This type of loyalty program leverages values important to the customer rather than financial discounts. For example, if many of a company’s customers are vegans, announcing that every purchase contributes to an “Animal Welfare” fund could generate loyalty equal to-or even stronger than-financial discounts, because the value of supporting animals resonates deeply with these customers.</p>",
    "<p>Value-based programs can be adapted to many types of businesses.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Strategic “All-Inclusive” Partnerships</strong></h3>",
    "<p>A strategic partnership with a complementary product or service in an “all-inclusive” approach can be highly effective for customer retention and revenue growth. By analyzing customer needs using a CRM system such as Skyz, businesses can tailor the right “all-inclusive package” that delivers real added value. Such programs not only retain and grow revenues from existing customers but also attract new ones through partner networks.</p>",
    "<p>These programs can suit a wide range of customers.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Gamified Loyalty Programs</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Gamified programs (competitions, raffles, challenges) have strong potential-after all, who doesn’t love games?-but they must be managed carefully. It’s important that participation requirements remain realistic and that winning chances do not fall below 30%–40%, otherwise customers may feel frustrated and disengage. Additionally, legal considerations must be addressed when running such programs.</p>",
    "<p>Gamified loyalty programs can work for all types of companies and greatly excite customers.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>The “Pioneers” Concept</strong></h3>",
    "<p>This loyalty concept gives existing customers early access to the newest and most innovative products. Discounts and financial incentives are less relevant here-the real value is in being the first to try something new and exciting.</p>",
    "<p>This program is best suited for innovation-driven companies.</p>",
    "<h2>How to Choose the Right Program for Your Organization?</h2>",
    "<p>First, assess your customers and the company’s ability to implement a loyalty program. As mentioned, some programs are better suited for B2B companies, others for large organizations, digital-first businesses, or innovation-driven firms. In general, it is recommended to start with the simpler and more popular programs and test their effectiveness using advanced CRM systems such as Skyz. If no improvement in customer retention is observed-or worse, if churn increases-analyze the causes (using CRM-generated reports). In some cases, it may be necessary to discontinue a program and switch to a different model.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>A successful loyalty program is a critical component of customer retention. There are various types of programs in the market today, such as: punch cards, points accumulation, tiered rewards systems, paid memberships, value-based loyalty, strategic partnerships, gamification, and the pioneers concept. It is advisable to match the program to your customers’ characteristics, start with simple and popular models, and evaluate performance continuously using an advanced CRM system.</p>"

      "title": "How to Better Drive Your Salespeople Forward",
  "content": [
    "<p>There’s no doubt that you also want your sales department to achieve results and increase the company’s revenue and profitability. Sales target management is one of the most powerful driving forces for sales representatives, and proper use of it can significantly improve performance and deal closures.</p>",
    "<p>Below are some tips to help you maximize the results of sales target management and, as a result, sales in both the short and long term:</p>",
    "<h2>Set Sales Targets Wisely</h2>",
    "<p>Defining sales targets is no simple task. There are many factors to consider: the salesperson’s personal abilities, the type of product being sold, the target audience, seasonal effects, and the market environment (such as competitor promotions). These factors must be weighed to set achievable goals. It is especially important to define short weekly or monthly targets to make it easier for salespeople to reach their quotas.</p>",
    "<h2>Set Gradual Goals at a Reasonable Pace</h2>",
    "<p>If your salespeople are currently making 100 sales calls per week and you want to double the number of calls to generate more potential deals, don’t double it overnight. Instead, set gradual goals that allow the salesperson to progress realistically, without overloading them with work that could cause frustration. Remember, a salesperson represents the face of your company and must remain fresh and optimistic-otherwise their sales calls will not be effective, and they won’t be able to reach the targets.</p>",
    "<h2>Instruct Salespeople to Prioritize Goals</h2>",
    "<p>Often, for various reasons, it’s difficult for salespeople to meet their monthly or quarterly quota. Therefore, it’s your responsibility to guide them in prioritizing their goals along the way. For example, if a salesperson realizes that due to a dynamic and highly competitive market environment it will be difficult to reach the planned quota in the coming quarter, they should focus on the most strategically important clients for the organization. This way, even if the quota is not fully met, the salesperson will still feel they achieved a significant organizational goal.</p>",
    "<h2>Build an Action Plan Together with Salespeople</h2>",
    "<p>As with any goal-oriented process, in order to reach the quota, a salesperson needs an action plan. It is recommended to sit down with your salespeople and plan the required active steps together: defining stages of reaching target audiences, choosing the right approach (such as phone calls or emails). Additionally, use a CRM system to analyze the salesperson’s success history to estimate how many calls, emails, and meetings are required to achieve actual closures. This helps determine whether the target is realistically achievable.</p>",
    "<p>For example: If the quota is 50,000₪ per month, which equals 4 average deals, and the conversion rate from meetings to deals is 50%, while the conversion from relevant phone calls to meetings is 10%, then a salesperson needs to conduct around 80 meaningful phone calls per month to reach the goal. Of course, this is only an estimate and may vary depending on internal and external factors.</p>",
    "<h2>Ensure Ongoing Progress Tracking</h2>",
    "<p>It is very important that both you and your salespeople maintain organized tracking of progress toward the goal. This becomes highly effective when using a customer relationship management system (preferably a cloud solution like Skyz CRM), which allows salespeople to manage processes correctly and provides you with real-time visibility into their progress toward the targets. If you identify a downward trend with a salesperson, call them in, understand the issue, and guide them back on track before they become frustrated.</p>",
    "<h2>Be Flexible with Sales Quotas</h2>",
    "<p>Sales closure rates vary over time. If you see that a highly driven salesperson is about to achieve the quota easily, it’s worth stretching the goal slightly-realistically but not excessively. Similarly, for salespeople going through a difficult period, you may adjust the quota downward. The important thing is to maintain motivation and reduce frustration.</p>",
    "<h2>Encourage Teamwork</h2>",
    "<p>Boost salespeople’s motivation by encouraging teamwork from time to time. Set goals for groups or departments and reward them as a unit. The mutual collaboration among salespeople is highly valuable for maximizing conversion rates into actual deals. Shared knowledge and brainstorming can help tackle complex cases and even rescue “lost” deals.</p>",
    "<h2>Invest in Small Incentives</h2>",
    "<p>It’s highly recommended to invest in small, short-term incentives, such as weekly or monthly bonuses, rather than relying only on quarterly, semi-annual, or annual quotas. Define more short-term goals and reward them accordingly. This creates stronger motivation and helps maintain it continuously. Long-term goals, which may feel distant, often cause reduced effort, so it’s important to emphasize daily and weekly targets.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>Invest more in motivating your salespeople. They are your engine for revenue growth. Set sales goals wisely, establish gradual and prioritized objectives, build an action plan, and ensure progress tracking using a professional CRM system. Be flexible with quotas, promote teamwork, and provide incentives. Combining these actions will help you generate motivation among your salespeople and improve both revenue and profitability!</p>"

       "title": "Why Call Recording in the Cloud CRM Era Enhances Customer Service",
  "content": [
    "<p>Outstanding customer service is one of the key factors in reducing customer churn, strengthening loyalty, building reputation, and ultimately making the organization more efficient and profitable. In this article, I would like to focus on one of the most important components of customer service operations – call recording*.</p>",
    "<p>* This article refers to the service, marketing, and management aspects, but not the legal side. Call recording must be carried out in accordance with Israeli law and its amendments.</p>",
    "<h2>Why Is Call Recording Important in Customer Service Departments?</h2>",
    "<h2>Call Monitoring</h2>",
    "<p>Call recording allows you to effectively measure the quality of customer service calls at both the individual and department levels. Department managers can monitor every interaction between agents and customers and improve performance when necessary to maximize customer satisfaction.</p>",
    "<h2>Resolving Misunderstandings and Disputes</h2>",
    "<p>Disagreements and conflicts often arise between customers and service representatives. Call recording serves as a critical tool for dispute resolution, as it provides factual proof of what was actually said during the call. Using recordings helps uncover the truth and prevents complications that could lead to legal issues and significant financial damage to the organization.</p>",
    "<h2>In-Depth Analysis of Service Calls</h2>",
    "<p>Call recordings give you the ability to analyze conversations at high resolution and with maximum flexibility. You can examine all aspects of the call-from the agent’s initial response, through their customer interactions, to specific moments during the conversation. This allows you to identify failures or successes and analyze them thoroughly.</p>",
    "<h2>Effective Training for New Agents</h2>",
    "<p>Call recordings can be used to train new service representatives by playing transcripts and demonstrating correct and incorrect scenarios in a live format, along with clear guidelines. Over time, you can train them using their own recordings, implement improvements, and maintain continuous supervision.</p>",
    "<h2>Business Insights (Micro & Macro)</h2>",
    "<p>Call recordings serve as a valuable source of business insights. They allow you to better understand what works and what doesn’t in your active marketing campaigns, gain a clearer picture of trends in customer service, and learn what truly happens “in real life” with customers. These insights help you tailor, market, and develop better products for customers, ultimately increasing revenue and profitability.</p>",
    "<h2>How Does Call Recording Add Value in the Cloud CRM Era?</h2>",
    "<h2>Advanced Service Department Management</h2>",
    "<p>The ability to attach call recordings directly to customer profiles in cloud-based CRM software such as Skyz significantly improves service department efficiency. This allows you to quickly retrieve any call recording from anywhere, in real time-for monitoring, resolving disputes with angry customers, analyzing calls, training, or generating valuable insights.</p>",
    "<h2>Efficient Workflows for Service Agents</h2>",
    "<p>Customer service is often stressful and requires maximum efficiency from agents. Integrating call recordings into CRM customer profiles enhances workflow speed. Agents can now listen to recordings online during the conversation itself, send them by email if necessary, and deliver more accurate and high-quality service.</p>",
    "<h2>Clearer and More Accurate Insights</h2>",
    "<p>Easy access to call recordings (from anywhere via CRM) and the ability to highlight important points in the customer profile create a rich, multi-use information database. The ability to analyze trends and processes at both the individual and department levels gains significant leverage, enabling you to produce more accurate and highly valuable reports. This, in turn, provides clearer insights for better customer service management.</p>",
    "<h2>Significant Time and Cost Savings</h2>",
    "<p>Working with cloud-based systems, especially CRM, allows you to manage customer service from anywhere, in real time. This ensures immediate access to recordings without unnecessary delays. Agents can listen to and analyze calls even from home or outside the office, saving valuable time and reducing organizational costs.</p>",
    "<h2>Wider Use Among SMBs</h2>",
    "<p>Traditionally, call recording in customer service departments was a practice limited to large organizations. Today, cloud technology-especially CRM-has made it accessible to medium and small businesses, enabling them to elevate their customer service and operate “like the big players.”</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>Call recording itself is highly valuable for customer service in any organization. When combined with cloud-based CRM systems, its benefits multiply significantly, providing: <b>advanced service management, greater agent efficiency, clearer insights, substantial time and cost savings, and broader adoption among SMBs.</b></p>"

      "title": "CRM: The Latest Trends You Need to Know!",
  "content": [
    "<p>The early beginnings of customer relationship management (CRM) could already be seen during the shift to mass consumption and the rise of corporations. The transition from personal relationships between “regular sellers” and “regular buyers” to selling to larger, unknown audiences forced companies to develop tactics and smart practices in order to acquire new customers.</p>",
    "<p>Over time, toward the end of the last century and with the computer revolution, we saw the first basic versions of CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software. These became a central component in managing customer relations-from lead generation to closing deals.</p>",
    "<p>The first CRM systems did not remain static-they continuously adapted to technological advances and the needs of the new era. In this article, I will review the most prominent and important trends that have shaped CRM and its capabilities in recent years.</p>",
    "<h2>360° Real-Time View</h2>",
    "<p>The 360° trend is a highly valuable asset for users looking to improve the efficiency of sales, service, and marketing processes in organizations. The ability to get a complete picture at a glance, covering all activities and processes without unnecessary navigation between modules, accelerates workflow and customer response times while saving valuable time. One of the leading platforms in this trend is Skyz CRM, which made this a central element in the development of its advanced system.</p>",
    "<h2>Cloud Technology</h2>",
    "<p>Everyone is talking about cloud technology, and CRM is no exception. This trend allows users to manage customer relations from anywhere, in real time, making every minute productive. Cloud CRM gives new customers instant access to the system hosted in the provider’s data centers, eliminating the need for costly investments in IT infrastructure, maintenance, and manpower. In addition, users benefit from advanced technology and multi-layered data security (including disaster recovery plans).</p>",
    "<h2>SaaS Model</h2>",
    "<p>The SaaS (Software as a Service) model has gained momentum in recent years, including in Israel, particularly in CRM. Business customers are realizing the advantages of this model: greater flexibility (start with a small number of users and expand), significant reduction in infrastructure and IT costs, the option to discontinue service if needed, and economic viability in terms of costs and maintenance.</p>",
    "<h2>Automation and Integration</h2>",
    "<p>Another growing trend in CRM systems is the emphasis on automation and integration. The idea is to maximize efficiency and enable processes to be executed quickly, with minimal clicks and screen transitions. A good example of this added value can be seen in the automatic filing of emails into customer records in Skyz CRM. Its seamless integration with email software, such as Outlook, allows users to automatically archive important emails directly under the relevant project in the customer profile.</p>",
    "<h2>Mobile</h2>",
    "<p>Alongside the development of cloud technology, mobile devices have evolved from simple communication tools into mini-computers central to daily life. This reality has pushed CRM systems to offer full customer management functionality-including data retrieval and actions-via smartphones and tablets. As part of this trend, user-friendly mobile applications were developed, with full responsive design tailored to every device and screen size, ensuring an excellent user experience (UX).</p>",
    "<h2>Social CRM</h2>",
    "<p>CRM systems are adapting to the social era with built-in collaboration features integrated with social networks. Whereas previously, software companies offered add-ons and plugins for existing CRM systems, the emerging trend is CRM platforms with embedded social components covering a wide range of sharing and collaboration aspects.</p>",
    "<h2>High-Resolution Data Analysis</h2>",
    "<p>The shift to cloud CRM systems and the frequency of user updates generate “big data,” forming an essential organizational knowledge base. This growing trend allows core systems to analyze data at high resolution across sales, marketing, and service, giving management teams deeper, more meaningful insights.</p>",
    "<h2>Smart Dashboards</h2>",
    "<p>Recent years have seen significant progress in CRM dashboards, now displaying reports and charts in advanced and effective graphic formats. These smart dashboards provide clear, real-time decision-making insights for managers. A prime example of this is the advanced approach implemented in Skyz CRM, which offers user-friendly dashboards integrated into every process related to customer relationship management.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>CRM systems have not remained indifferent to the internet and mobile revolutions of today’s dynamic era. We are witnessing new trends in CRM that include: real-time 360° views, cloud technology, SaaS models, automation and integration, mobile responsiveness, social CRM, high-resolution data analysis, and smart dashboards. These trends provide essential solutions for modern user needs and significantly enhance the added value of CRM systems for businesses of all sizes.</p>"

  "content": [
    "<p>The terms ERP and CRM have accompanied the business sector for many years and are familiar to many decision-makers. While their importance as core organizational systems is recognized, there isn’t always a full understanding of their roles, the differences between them, and how they can effectively work together.</p>",
    "<p>In this article, I will clearly and thoroughly explain the goals and importance of each system, outline the key differences between them, and highlight the major benefits of proper ERP-CRM integration for organizational productivity.</p>",
    "<h2>What Is an ERP System and What Is Its Purpose?</h2>",
    "<p>(ERP – Enterprise Resource Planning) is software designed for organizational resource planning. It is a business management system composed of modular applications that allow organizing, collecting, storing, managing, and interpreting data from various departments within an organization. ERP manages all the key areas of a business, such as procurement, sales, production, finance, inventory, decision-support systems, and more-improving business processes across the organization.</p>",
    "<p>The purpose of an ERP system is to enable fast information flow across all business functions through a centralized database. Once implemented, every department can access up-to-date shared information, operate more efficiently, and analyze profitability and performance at any given point in time.</p>",
    "<h2>What Is a CRM System and What Is Its Purpose?</h2>",
    "<p>(CRM – Customer Relationship Management) is software for managing relationships with potential and existing customers. It collects and shares customer data, catalogs interactions and processes, analyzes customer history, and enhances their overall experience.</p>",
    "<p>The purpose of a CRM system is to give users a real-time, accurate picture of customer-related processes and manage them effectively across sales, marketing, and service. Ultimately, through a quality database and advanced automation, CRM helps increase sales, boost marketing campaigns, and improve customer service.</p>",
    "<h2>What Are the Key Differences Between ERP and CRM?</h2>",
    "<ol><li>ERP is software that helps manage business processes across the organization, while CRM focuses on tracking and managing processes directly related to customers.</li><li>ERP systems consolidate data provided by various internal functions, whereas CRM systems operate on the customer-facing side, simplifying and optimizing customer interactions, tracking processes effectively, and generating smart reports for improving sales, marketing, and service.</li><li>ERP focuses primarily on cost reduction, while CRM focuses on increasing sales.</li><li>ERP evolved from the need to unify functional management systems that operated separately, while CRM evolved from the need to improve customer relationship management effectiveness.</li><li>CRM is typically used by small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with fewer departments, while ERP is more common in large organizations (sometimes alongside CRM).</li></ol>",
    "<h2>Which System Is More Important: CRM or ERP?</h2>",
    "<p>The answer depends on the stage of the company’s development. In large and mature organizations, both ERP and CRM are essential core systems. ERP improves efficiency across departments and reduces costs, while CRM boosts sales, increases profitability, and drives growth.</p>",
    "<p>However, in the early stages of a company’s development, decision-makers should prioritize sales growth, revenue, and profitability. In this case, CRM is undoubtedly more important because of its significant impact on sales process management and revenue generation.</p>",
    "<h2>What Is the Added Value of Proper Integration?</h2>",
    "<p>Proper integration between the two systems provides tremendous added value. ERP reduces overall operational costs, while CRM improves sales processes and automation. Together, they create a winning formula for business growth. Each system generates unique benefits on its own, but when integrated, the combined value far exceeds the sum of their individual contributions.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>ERP and CRM are both vital core systems for any organization. ERP focuses on reducing costs through efficient information flow between functions, while CRM focuses on managing, controlling, and advancing customer-related sales, marketing, and service processes through automation and effectiveness.</p>",
    "<p>CRM is more important in the early growth stages of a company, when boosting sales is critical. However, in later stages of development, both systems become indispensable, and their proper integration creates tremendous added value for the organization.</p>"

      "title": "Customer Expectations – Why It’s Important to Understand and Meet Them!",
      "content": [
    "<p>Most customers’ expectations when purchasing products or services are shaped by industry standards, the strength of the brand, sales promises, product perception, and recommendations. Improving customer satisfaction starts with truly understanding customer expectations during the purchase process and aligning with them.</p>",
    "<p>This article will outline the key factors that affect customer expectations, explain why it’s important to understand them even before a sale takes place, and provide practical tips to optimally meet those expectations.</p>",
    "<h2>Factors That Influence Customer Expectations</h2>",
    "<h3><strong>Customer Service</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Customers develop expectations when entering a service-oriented business relationship, such as staying at a hotel or dining at a restaurant. For example, consider a couple who just got married and books a premium hotel room at a relatively high price for their honeymoon weekend. Their expectations go beyond simply receiving a decent, high-standard room. They anticipate extra care, such as a warm welcome or a special surprise, due to the nature of their occasion.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Customers always expect at least the minimum promised standard. Returning to the hotel example, the couple booking a premium room at a high rate would not accept anything less than what was promised. While they might forgive the absence of extras, receiving less than the agreed standard would generate frustration and a strong negative perception of the hotel.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Modern Processes</strong></h3>",
    "<p>The digital revolution has dramatically influenced both customer service and consumer expectations. Customers today expect companies to operate efficiently and adopt modern, digital-first processes. Online access and mobile integration are now standard expectations in the customer relationship.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Relationship Quality</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Customers are people first and foremost, which means they expect warm and pleasant interactions with service representatives. Often, the human factor is what determines whether an organization succeeds or fails in creating a positive experience that affects future loyalty.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Keeping Promises</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Sales representatives’ promises are a major driver of customer expectations. These promises, whether formally documented or not, influence customers’ decisions to close deals. Failure to meet these expectations results in disappointment, erodes trust, and can seriously harm the customer relationship.</p>",
    "<h2>The Added Value of Understanding Customer Expectations</h2>",
    "<h3><strong>Significant Reduction in Complaints</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Complaints are the direct result of unmet expectations. Understanding expectations in advance allows organizations to adjust their customer service processes accordingly, dramatically reducing complaints and improving satisfaction.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Clear Benchmark for Service Standards</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Understanding expectations provides a reliable benchmark for the required service level. This is critical because many organizations struggle to identify the exact service standard that meets customer needs.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Brand Strengthening</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Meeting expectations consistently transforms both new and returning customers into strong advocates. Nothing strengthens a brand more than positive recommendations. A strong brand sets high expectations among new customers, but if those are met, the brand’s impact grows even further.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong></h3>",
    "<p>While competitors may overlook the importance of meeting customer expectations, you can gain a significant edge by understanding and aligning with them. This strategic approach enhances service levels and positions your company ahead of the competition.</p>",
    "<h2>Tips for Meeting Customer Expectations</h2>",
    "<h3><strong>Create Tiered Product/Service Packages</strong></h3>",
    "<p>One effective way to meet customer expectations is by offering tiered product or service packages. This strategy benefits customer service in two ways:</p>",
    "<ul><li>It provides a clearer definition of product or service standards, reducing unrealistic customer expectations.</li><li>It enables upgrades to higher levels with added bonuses or free perks, significantly improving satisfaction. After all, who doesn’t love surprises?</li></ul>",
    "<h3><strong>Build Genuine Connections with Customers</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Developing authentic relationships helps bridge gaps when service falls short. Even if there are delays or shortfalls, a genuine connection can leave customers feeling valued and satisfied despite the issues.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Stand Firm Behind Sales Promises</strong></h3>",
    "<p>This is critical! When sales reps make promises, they create expectations. Any deviation frustrates customers. Service teams must do everything possible to honor those promises, and if technical limitations make it impossible, they should compensate customers in a way that leaves them satisfied.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Extras and Surprises</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Doing more than expected creates a memorable customer experience that can spread virally. Small extras, included in the service at no additional cost, or fun surprises can delight customers and turn them into advocates.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Expectation Alignment in Changing Environments</strong></h3>",
    "<p>In today’s dynamic world, customer expectations shift constantly due to internal and external factors. Proactively aligning expectations by explaining circumstances and changes prevents misunderstandings and keeps customers satisfied, even when adjustments are necessary.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Face-to-Face Meetings</strong></h3>",
    "<p>In cases of significant disappointment, meeting customers in person can resolve misunderstandings and rebuild trust. Even with non-strategic customers, face-to-face efforts can turn dissatisfaction into loyalty. As you know, reputations are easier to harm than to build, so proactive effort is worth it.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>The added value of understanding customer expectations is substantial: fewer complaints, a clear benchmark for service standards, stronger branding, and a competitive edge. To meet expectations, it is recommended to offer tiered service packages, build authentic connections, honor sales promises, provide extras and surprises, align expectations in dynamic markets, and, when necessary, hold face-to-face meetings. These practices will help you maximize customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>"

      "title": "Document Management: How Important Is Integration with a CRM System?",
      "content": [
    "<p>A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system is designed to efficiently manage all workflows with customers in sales, marketing, and service. In terms of added value, it provides: a real-time overview of all customer interactions, accurate process tracking, effective task management, and essential report generation.</p>",
    "<p>However, while CRM systems do their job well in improving business processes, without addressing document management, they do not provide a truly comprehensive solution for customer management.</p>",
    "<h2>Why Is Document Management So Important for CRM?</h2>",
    "<p>The answer is simple. Working with customers today requires extensive documentation: Word files, price lists, proposals, contracts, purchase orders, and more. A significant amount of time is wasted on creating documents, linking them to customers or projects, and retrieving them later. If even the best CRM system cannot handle document management effectively, its overall efficiency drops dramatically, since a large portion of customer interaction revolves around files and documents.</p>",
    "<h2>DMS + CRM – A Winning Combination!</h2>",
    "<p>To understand the added value of integrating a CRM system with a Document Management System (DMS), let’s look at an example where the systems are separate:</p>",
    "<p>A salesperson at Company X (which has independent CRM and DMS systems) is negotiating with a customer before closing a deal. The process involves extensive correspondence and multiple revised price quotes before a final contract is signed.</p>",
    "<p>The CRM helps the salesperson track progress, create reminders, and present an overview. But when they need to access previous quotes or price lists sent to the customer, they must open the DMS, search, and retrieve the file-wasting valuable minutes, especially during a live call with the customer.</p>",
    "<p>With integration, all files would be directly linked to the customer profile, and retrieving the right document would take just one click. This illustrates the immense added value of CRM-DMS integration-or of using an advanced CRM with built-in document management capabilities.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Here are the key advantages of integration and its enormous contribution to the effectiveness of management and sales, marketing, and service teams:</strong></p>",
    "<h2>Full Process Automation</h2>",
    "<p>Integration enables direct access to documents from the customer profile or project record. Throughout the customer relationship, every relevant document-proposals, contracts, communications-remains immediately accessible, streamlining the workflow and ensuring efficiency.</p>",
    "<h2>Real-Time File Sharing</h2>",
    "<p>With integration, CRM systems allow teams and managers not only to monitor actions and reports but also to share related documents (letters, proposals, contracts) in real time. This is especially effective in cloud-based, mobile-friendly systems, which let users access important files anywhere, anytime.</p>",
    "<h2>Faster Document Creation</h2>",
    "<p>Another benefit is the efficiency of document creation. CRM systems can automatically pull customer and deal data from the database, saving users from unnecessary typing. Many systems also provide smart, pre-designed templates for a wide range of document needs.</p>",
    "<h2>Optimized Workflow</h2>",
    "<p>Documents such as proposals, contracts, and key letters often require approval and signatures at higher levels. DMS-CRM integration streamlines this process: approval workflows can be defined in the CRM, and automation ensures documents move smoothly through the process until they are sent to the customer.</p>",
    "<h2>Smart Retrieval</h2>",
    "<p>Integrated systems greatly improve the ability to search and retrieve documents. Files are linked directly to customers or projects, saving significant time and sometimes eliminating the need for manual searches altogether.</p>",
    "<h2>Significant Time Savings</h2>",
    "<p>Integration saves valuable time in every aspect of customer management: faster workflows, quicker document retrieval, real-time responses (by opening files during customer interactions), and quicker document creation. Together, these efficiencies save many work hours across the organization.</p>",
    "<h2>Excellent User Experience</h2>",
    "<p>Today’s business environment emphasizes user experience. Integration between DMS and CRM contributes significantly by allowing users to access any related document at any point in the customer process, while simplifying document creation. This enhances user satisfaction and significantly boosts productivity.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>Integrating document management with CRM is not just important-it’s critical. This winning combination delivers enormous added value through: full workflow automation, real-time file sharing, faster document creation, optimized approval workflows, smart retrieval, significant time savings, and an excellent user experience.</p>"

    "<p>As noted in the article <a href=\"http://skyzblog.co.il/erp-%D7%95-crm-%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%91%D7%93%D7%9C-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99-%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%A8/\">comparing ERP and CRM</a>, CRM plays a central role in customer-facing processes. We all understand that automation in CRM boosts the efficiency of sales and service representatives. But what’s equally important is how this improves the customer’s overall experience. That’s the focus of this article.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>So, what are the key factors by which Cloud CRM improves customer experience?</strong></h3>",
    "<h2>Service from Anywhere, in Real Time</h2>",
    "<p>When customers have a question or problem, they want quick responses. CRM systems were designed to provide fast, effective support. Moving CRM to the cloud takes service to the next level, enabling customers to receive professional assistance from anywhere-office, field, home, or abroad-in real time.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Result: Faster, professional responses that increase satisfaction and enhance customer experience.</strong></p>",
    "<h2>On-the-Spot Data and Information Retrieval</h2>",
    "<p>Customers expect immediate solutions. The big advantage of cloud CRM is the ability to retrieve data, information, and reports online from anywhere. For example, a technician in the field can access service agreements or contracts instantly via smartphone, resolving issues on the spot without delays.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Result: Shorter processes and time savings that improve customer experience.</strong></p>",
    "<h2>More Up-to-Date Databases</h2>",
    "<p>Cloud CRM allows users to update information anytime, anywhere. This creates more detailed and accurate databases, enhancing customer insights. As a result, service and sales reps can provide customers with precise, timely answers.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Result: Quick, accurate solutions to complex issues that strengthen customer experience.</strong></p>",
    "<h2>Real-Time Knowledge Sharing</h2>",
    "<p>In today’s world, real-time knowledge sharing is highly valuable. Cloud CRM significantly enhances the ability to share expertise among specialists, managers, and colleagues from anywhere. This ensures customers receive smarter, more informed responses faster.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Result: Up-to-date, expert knowledge delivered instantly, improving customer experience.</strong></p>",
    "<h2>Leveraging Automation for Customers</h2>",
    "<p>Cloud CRM can also benefit customers directly through its automation and knowledge features. For instance, sales agents can access real-time dashboards for deals and commissions, while end customers can log in to 24/7 knowledge bases with manuals, FAQs, and tips. This makes customer interactions smoother and more rewarding.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Result: Customers enjoy smarter, more convenient access to information and services, dramatically improving their experience.</strong></p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>Cloud CRM improves not only the user experience of sales and service staff but also the customer experience itself. The key factors include: real-time service from anywhere, instant data retrieval, more up-to-date databases, real-time knowledge sharing, and accessible automation for customers. Together, these make customer interactions faster, smarter, and more satisfying.</p>"

      "content": [
  "<p>A CRM system in the modern era can no longer be just another customer relationship management tool.

  "<h2>Attractive SaaS Model</h2>",
  "<p>The Skyz CRM work model with clients is based on Software as a Service (SaaS).

  "<h2>Smart Dashboards in Every Process</h2>",
  "<p>One of Skyz CRM’s unique features is the integration of smart dashboards into every customer-related process. In today’s era, when managers seek quick snapshots of real-time processes, this feature becomes a true advantage. The dashboard presents the required information clearly, visually, and within the process itself, giving decision-makers rapid insights for providing timely and effective responses.</p>",
  "<h2>Customer Success-Centric Design</h2>",

In fact, Skyz helps its clients not only to be effective in sales, service, and marketing but also to leverage the system’s benefits to better serve their own customers.</p>",
  "<p>For example: a Skyz client marketing a unique service through external agencies can enable agents to operate independently within Skyz CRM, track completed deals online, monitor sales commissions, retrieve updated product information in real time, and more.</p>",
  "<h2>Full Integration with Email Applications</h2>",
  "<p>Skyz CRM allows full synchronization with a wide range of popular email applications using advanced automation. Emails are filed directly within the customer record, enabling users to track activities with customers along with email correspondence.</p>",

  "<h2>Excellent Solution for SMBs</h2>",
  "<p>Skyz CRM provides a significant advantage for SMBs (Small and Medium Businesses) across a wide range of industries. The system allows these businesses to connect without investing in expensive infrastructure or equipment, while leveraging management tools and features typically reserved for enterprise-level systems. As a result, small and medium-sized firms can significantly reduce technological, operational, sales, and marketing gaps, and compete with larger players without feeling disadvantaged.</p>",

       "title": "Up-to-Date Shared Knowledge: A Marketing Asset of Great Importance to the Organization!",
"content": [
    "<p>There is no need to overstate the immense importance of access to knowledge in the modern era. Accurate and relevant knowledge today is not only power, but far more-especially when it comes to the marketing aspect of businesses and firms.</p>",
    "<p>In this article, I will describe the evolution of shared knowledge in business, highlight the importance of its management, updating, and renewal for organizations, and provide key tips for turning accumulated knowledge into a vital organizational asset.</p>",
    "<h2>The Evolution of Shared Knowledge in Business</h2>",
    "<p>Business knowledge sources in the 1970s and 1980s focused mainly on business and professional journalism, printed newsletters, television, radio, seminars, professional conferences, exhibitions, meetings, phone calls, and “word of mouth.” These sources provided managers and executives in organizations with essential insights on innovations, trends, industries and markets, “players,” and audiences in relevant fields. It is important to note that in order to collect information from various relevant areas, considerable effort was required.</p>",
    "<p>Knowledge sharing within organizations took place through training sessions, weekly meetings, and internal discussions. Most of it was captured in employees’ notebooks, their minds, and to a small extent in the personal computers that began entering offices at that time.</p>",
    "<p>The 1990s marked the beginning of a dramatic shift in shared knowledge with the communication revolution, as the internet and mobile phones became integral parts of our lives. The internet provided us with online information, which expanded year after year as networks and storage capacities grew. The transition from mobile phones to smartphones in the early 2000s marked another leap, thanks to the ability to access information from anywhere in real time.</p>",
    "<p>Knowledge sharing received a massive boost from several factors:</p>",
    "<ul><li>The pace of information renewal driven by the internet, mobile, and online access</li><li>The development of advanced CRM systems (Customer Relationship Management)</li><li>The shift toward cloud computing services</li><li>The immense popularity of social networks</li></ul>",
    "<p>These factors reshaped behavior and work culture in businesses and organizations with regard to knowledge sharing. First, access to knowledge from anywhere in real time turned every employee into a potential “knowledge carrier.” Second, the sheer volume of knowledge transformed the approach from “collect all possible information” to “filter quality information.” Third, the internet, cloud technologies, and mobile made information sharing fast and automatic.</p>",
    "<h2>The Name of the Game: Managing, Updating, and Renewing Knowledge</h2>",
    "<p>Knowledge behaves like a product-perhaps even more so. It must be maintained, improved, and kept current. The internet age changed the rules of the game not only in terms of accessing existing information but also in easily publishing new knowledge online. This requires organizations to treat the entire process of creating <u>filtered, high-quality, updated, and innovative shared knowledge</u> with great seriousness.</p>",
    "<p>Shared organizational knowledge is derived from three main sources:</p>",
    "<p><strong>Exogenous knowledge</strong> – knowledge acquired from external media channels (press, internet, TV) and industry experts or other players (through seminars, conferences, and exhibitions).</p>",
    "<p><strong>Endogenous knowledge</strong> – knowledge acquired from processes and changes within the organization itself, including all scenarios and events (from which lessons can be learned) at both management and employee levels.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Customer and supplier knowledge</strong> – knowledge derived from interactions with customers, suppliers, and strategic partners, including operational history, handling complex situations (sales, service), and critical insights.</p>",
    "<p>When efficiently collected and translated into filtered, high-quality, and updated shared knowledge, these three sources become invaluable assets for the organization.</p>",
    "<h2>Tips for Turning Knowledge into a Powerful Marketing Asset</h2>",
    "<h3><strong>Embedding a Shared Knowledge Culture</strong></h3>",
    "<p>One of the essential steps management must take in the modern era is embedding a culture of shared knowledge among employees. This move should even be part of the company’s long-term strategic plan. Every employee must understand that their contribution to the organization is measured not only by the performance of their defined role but also as a “shared knowledge leader” for the organization. This includes identifying and sharing essential knowledge, updating existing knowledge when needed, and improving effectiveness by leveraging the organization’s knowledge repositories.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Advanced Cloud-Based CRM System</strong></h3>",
    "<p>To manage knowledge effectively and intelligently, I strongly recommend using an advanced cloud-based CRM system. Such systems offer tremendous advantages in today’s mobile and cloud-driven world:</p>",
    "<ul><li>Knowledge sharing from anywhere in real time</li><li>Online updates of essential knowledge on processes with suppliers and customers (creating a knowledge base unavailable anywhere else)</li><li>Advanced filtering capabilities for effective information screening</li><li>Automatic linking of knowledge to customer records</li><li>Quick and efficient search and retrieval of information, documents, and files</li></ul>",
    "<h3><strong>Internal Knowledge Management Experts</strong></h3>",
    "<p>As part of ongoing operations, company CEOs should empower existing knowledge managers or establish such roles in organizations not yet ready for them. These experts should oversee all shared knowledge, define objectives, build and implement work plans, preserve and develop the organization’s knowledge culture, train and promote knowledge leaders, and ensure adoption of knowledge management tools.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Defining Processes and Knowledge Flow</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Managing shared knowledge requires well-defined processes, including clear knowledge flow paths (workflows). It is recommended to define these organizational processes in joint meetings led by knowledge managers (with CEO involvement as well). These processes must align with the organization’s type and culture in order to maximize effectiveness. Beyond definitions, it is critical that knowledge managers oversee the implementation of processes in practice, as well as the use of technological tools-particularly cloud-based CRM systems-that ultimately deliver real results.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion</h2>",
    "<p>High-quality shared knowledge is a marketing asset of enormous importance to any organization. To leverage shared knowledge, it must be managed, updated, and renewed continuously. To achieve this, it is recommended to implement the following tips: embed a culture of shared knowledge, use an advanced cloud-based CRM system, appoint internal knowledge management experts, and define clear processes and knowledge flow.</p>"

      "title": "The Era of 'One-Time Closing' Is Over. Moving Toward Smart, Step-by-Step Selling!",
"content": [
    "<p>There is no doubt that the goal of sales representatives is to maximize deal closures and meet required quotas. At first glance, the sales process seems like it should be linear and lead to a happy ending. However, we all learn over time that sales processes are not idyllic but rather full of complexities and challenges.</p>",
    "<p>In this article, I will describe the impact of the new era on sales tactics and the shift from closing as a one-time event to a step-by-step sales process. I will explain the drivers behind this change, highlight the significant added value for organizations, and provide recommendations for implementation.</p>",
    "<h2>What Was and What Is Now?</h2>",
    "<p>In the past, the sales approach was based on a linear perception leading to the desired 'closing.' In other words, the goal was to move as quickly as possible toward closing the deal as a one-time defining event. Today, however, due to the drivers I will outline later, we need to view things differently. To ensure linear progress toward the deal, we advance step by step, <strong><u>with each step creating a positive and upward move</u></strong> toward completing the sale.</p>",
    "<p>Here are some examples of such steps in this new step-by-step approach:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>A request for a short phone call</li>",
    "<li>An invitation to deliver a sales presentation</li>",
    "<li>A request to connect with the customer on a social network</li>",
    "<li>Asking permission to add the customer to a mailing list</li>",
    "<li>Suggesting a casual coffee meeting</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<h2>What Drives the Shift to Step-by-Step Selling?</h2>",
    "<p>The modern era has brought dramatic changes to the business world: information available everywhere, dependence on mobile, multiple communication channels, the impact of social networks, and increased competition. These factors have caused cultural, operational, and marketing shifts in nearly every organization, influencing sales tactics for the following reasons:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>Accessible online information about industries, competitors, and prices makes the decision-making process harder and longer. In the past, when a salesperson called, customers often did not know 'what they were missing,' as they did not have fast access to information.</li>",
    "<li>Sharing on social networks adds another dimension of real-time recommendations about organizations, suppliers, and products. Customers are continuously influenced by others’ opinions.</li>",
    "<li>The modern era is characterized by automation and less human interaction 'like in the old days.' Yet it turns out that customers still need ongoing personal attention and warmth to connect with a brand or company.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<h2>The Added Value</h2>",
    "<h3><strong>Increasing Sales Volume</strong></h3>",
    "<p>The 'step-by-step' sales tactic increases your organization’s sales over time. The 'one-shot' method of quickly moving on to the next potential customer may seem more efficient (by avoiding time wasted on tough customers), but in today’s environment (as explained above), the rules of the game have changed. Prospects require patience from sales reps. They are market-savvy, well-informed, and not quick to decide.</p>",
    "<p>The importance of small-step progress is tremendous. On one hand, there is no unnecessary pressure on the customer, and on the other, progress is still being made. This is an excellent formula for getting the most out of each sales process and achieving many more deals in the long run.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Creating a Sense of Personal Connection</strong></h3>",
    "<p>The staged selling tactic turns the sales process into a culture of ongoing personal connection. This culture is vital in today’s world, not only until the deal is closed but also afterward.</p>",
    "<p>Customers today seek closeness and personal attention both before and after the deal. A progressive, positive, step-by-step sales process generates optimism, supports deal closure, and strengthens long-term relationships.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Positivity and Loyalty Driven by a 'Customer Success' Mindset</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Smart step-by-step selling changes the concept entirely. The relationship with the prospect shifts from 'just trying to sell' to 'helping them succeed.' The customer perceives that you are not only aiming for a fast sale but also ensuring their satisfaction throughout the process and after they begin using the product.</p>",
    "<p>The added value of this conceptual shift is enormous. It makes the customer more positive toward closing the deal and more loyal once they become an actual client.</p>",
    "<h2>Recommendations for Implementation</h2>",
    "<p>To successfully apply the 'step-by-step' sales tactic and increase organizational value, I recommend the following steps:</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Shift to Ongoing Personal Engagement</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Your sales reps must build continuous personal relationships with customers, not only when they think it’s the right 'timing' for closing the deal. The customer needs to <em>feel</em> your constant closeness, even during hesitant phases of the 'in-progress' deal.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Emphasize Customer Success</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Equally important is emphasizing the customer’s success. Every step in the process should consider the client’s true best interest, which may include: adjusting to the customer’s pace (not yours) regarding the 'timing' of the deal closure, addressing their specific needs (e.g., requiring a product demo), or respecting budget limitations (e.g., offering installment options).</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Work with a Cloud-Based CRM System</strong></h3>",
    "<p>The most critical recommendation is to work with a customer relationship management (CRM) system, preferably cloud-based. A CRM system can efficiently manage your sales stages, send reminders for necessary steps toward progress, and accumulate valuable knowledge. This data helps you profile customers and understand the best next steps (which vary per customer) to advance them toward becoming loyal clients.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion:</h2>",
    "<p>The new era has changed the way prospects think, requiring sales tactics to adapt. The 'one-time closing' approach is history. Today’s suitable tactic is a 'step-by-step' process, where each stage generates upward linear progress toward deal completion. The added value of this tactic is immense, reflected in increased long-term sales, stronger personal connections, greater positivity, and improved customer loyalty.</p>",
    "<p>To implement this tactic successfully, sales reps must adopt a mindset of ongoing personal engagement, actively support customer success during and after the process, and leverage advanced CRM systems to optimize increasingly smart and complex sales processes.</p>"

      "title": "How a Successful Onboarding Process Increases Long-Term Revenue",
      "content": [
    "<p>Without a doubt, building customer success is one of the hottest global trends in modern businesses. This trend is evolving into a full discipline (at least in North America) with everything that comes with it: dedicated experts (Customer Success Managers), professional knowledge, training, key terminology, and more. One of the most important concepts that serves as a central component of customer success is called “Onboarding,” which I will expand upon in this article, along with its contribution to the organization.</p>",
    "<h2>What is Customer Onboarding?</h2>",
    "<p>The term “Onboarding” refers to the initial interaction between company representatives (usually sales) and new potential customers. Onboarding is a highly significant point in the customer experience. It is the first interaction (negotiations and everything around them) with the customer, influencing their first impression of both the product and the company. Successful onboarding gives the potential customer a positive feeling, motivates them to become an actual customer, and introduces them optimistically and confidently into a long-term relationship.</p>",
    "<h2>How Does It Impact Revenue Growth?</h2>",
    "<p>The formula is simple: <strong>Successful Onboarding = Positive First Impression = Internal Sense of Confidence = Customer Loyalty and Repeat Purchases</strong>. Once we achieve loyal and satisfied customers, revenue per customer grows-not only due to strong loyalty but also thanks to their positive inclination to purchase upsells and cross-sells from a trusted company.</p>",
    "<h2>Key Factors for Successful Onboarding</h2>",
    "<p>To run a proper onboarding process, it is highly recommended to take the following important factors seriously:</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Building an Engagement Model</strong></h3>",
    "<p>A significant factor in successful onboarding is developing an engagement model with the customer. The model should define how the customer is integrated and how the company continues to support them post-sale. Engagement models vary between companies depending on organizational nature, product type, target audiences, and market environment.</p>",
    "<p>For example: Some brands require high-touch interaction with customers, demanding substantial resources, while others operate with much lighter direct interaction and more indirect communication.</p>",
    "<p>It is crucial to design the right engagement model for the company, while always keeping in mind the common principle: <strong>Working closely with the customer at the right pace!!</strong></p>",
    "<h3><strong>Skilled Customer Success Managers</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Onboarding requires professionals who can manage the process effectively. In many organizations, we already see the role of Customer Success Managers (CSMs), who are responsible for running the process.</p>",
    "<p>Alternatively, if no such role exists, a manager can be specially trained and equipped with the necessary tools to build customer success. The job title doesn’t matter as much as ensuring that onboarding is managed by someone knowledgeable, capable of building the right engagement model and guiding the process wisely.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Advanced CRM System</strong></h3>",
    "<p>A critical tool for efficient onboarding management is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, especially in organizations with many customers. As noted, the onboarding touchpoint is highly sensitive. Mistakes such as “forgetting to follow up with a customer when promised” can be fatal, while knowledge advantages can be game-changing in turning prospects into long-term customers.</p>",
    "<p>A CRM system (particularly cloud-based) can serve as an onboarding game-changer: online reminders about upcoming clients, real-time data retrieval, learning customer traits, and precise high-resolution tracking. All these create a significant advantage for the company.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Defining a Clear and Controlled Process</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Another key to efficient onboarding is designing a clear and structured process. Here, too, it’s recommended to work with a CRM system that includes a Workflow component, as in advanced systems such as Skyz CRM. The process should map out the sequence of actions and the responsible parties at each stage (including critical scenarios), while adapting to company-specific changes.</p>",
    "<p>The result: an organized and structured process, faster detection of issues, and improved oversight and control of the entire operation.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Customer Feedback</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Customer feedback is an excellent tool for understanding the mindset of newly onboarded clients. It fosters stronger connections, enhances the sense of involvement, and shows genuine care. Let’s not forget-new customers often still have reservations about their first engagement, and feedback mechanisms at this stage help alleviate concerns and strengthen confidence in the brand and company.</p>",
    "<p>Here as well, a CRM system can greatly assist by sending digital surveys efficiently and generating smart reports with quick insights for decision-making.</p>",
    "<h2><strong>Example:</strong></h2>",
    "<p>A company in the office furniture industry is negotiating advanced deals with two new customers. The onboarding process starts here and continues through the days after the furniture delivery and installation at the client sites. The Customer Success Manager’s role is to guide the process thoughtfully, remain responsive to questions and issues, provide reassurance, and ultimately create a positive impression that converts these customers into satisfied and loyal ones.</p>",
    "<p>For proper onboarding in this case, the following actions are recommended:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>Develop an engagement model that includes all stages from pre-sale to full installation, ensuring customer satisfaction. This model should account for industry specifics such as production delays, transportation, and especially delivery timelines.</li>",
    "<li>Appoint a company function responsible for customer success to provide full guidance throughout the process, with sensitivity to every issue.</li>",
    "<li>Use a CRM system (preferably cloud-based) for precise tracking, reminders, and real-time data, as well as for designing workflow processes (tasks and owners) and conducting customer surveys to build trust and care for the future.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<h2>Conclusion:</h2>",
    "<p>Onboarding is a key component of building customer success. A well-structured and efficient onboarding process can significantly improve customer loyalty and increase long-term revenue. The factors that contribute to successful onboarding include: designing a company-specific engagement model, managing the process with experts (CSMs), creating a clear and structured process, collecting customer feedback, and-most importantly-using an advanced CRM system (preferably cloud-based) as a primary tool to run the process through tracking, reminders, real-time insights, automated workflows, digital surveys, and smart reporting.</p>"

      "title": "Cloud CRM at the Service of Your Website – The Integration That Works Wonders!",
      "content": [
    "<p>The revolutionary new era we live in does not bypass websites. If in the late 1990s and early 2000s websites mainly served as business cards, today they have also become a marketing tool, a sales tool, an operational tool, and a knowledge center. It’s not just that without a website your company is practically non-existent (because you can’t do without an online presence), you are also losing a super-effective operational tool in terms of user experience.</p>",
    "<p>In this article, I will present the significant contribution of integrating Cloud CRM with the organization’s website, including a practical real-world example.</p>",
    "<h2>Advantages of Integrating a Website with CRM</h2>",
    "<h3><strong>Preventing the Loss of Important Leads</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Integrating the website with a customer relationship management system dramatically reduces the loss of important leads. The details of potential customers entered in the contact forms and CTAs (Call To Action) installed on the site are sent directly to the CRM system to open new customer records for follow-up and conversion into paying customers. Without this integration, in the case of a standard website, the details entered into contact forms would be sent to email and would have a high potential of getting lost among dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of incoming emails received by the organization daily.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Automation to Streamline Marketing</strong></h3>",
    "<p>The website serves as the organization’s “front face” in the ever-growing digital world. The more the website presents up-to-date and interesting data in high resolution and on a dynamic basis, the more serious it will appear to potential customers, creating a better driver for increasing revenue. Connecting the website to CRM turns the customer relationship management system into the “back office” and enables automatic updates such as products, prices, and essential knowledge easily and efficiently from within the CRM, including excellent control and monitoring capabilities. With Cloud CRM and mobile-adapted technology, everything can of course be done from anywhere, in real time.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Measuring ROI at High Resolution</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Receiving leads through website contact forms in the usual way is typically measured only by quantity. But were those leads truly effective? How many of them actually resulted in deals? That is very difficult to measure without a customer relationship management system. In contrast, connecting the website to an advanced Cloud CRM system allows leads to be monitored and tracked throughout the sales process until deal closure. Accurate campaign measurement becomes possible, with reports on conversion rates and return on investment easily generated. There is no doubt that analyzing results provides critical insights for improving and optimizing future campaigns.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Maximizing Sales to Potential Customers</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Filling out a more detailed contact form on a website connected to CRM enables understanding of which company and which role is interested in which product. This valuable information is routed in real time through the cloud-based CRM to the appropriate representative or manager to handle negotiations with that specific customer, significantly increasing the chances of an effective sales process leading to a closed deal.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>More Effective Support</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Connecting the website to CRM significantly enhances the growing trend of streamlining support via online forms on the company’s website. Thanks to this integration, when a support request form is submitted, the service representative can immediately see the customer’s profile, interaction history, characteristics, and any other crucial information, helping to resolve the issue or inquiry as quickly as possible.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Access to Real-Time Knowledge Centers</strong></h3>",
    "<p>This integration provides immense added value for customers, who can now connect through the company’s main website 24/7 from anywhere to access essential knowledge bases: FAQs, guides, events, solutions, and more. Dynamic updates made in the CRM by the company’s marketing and sales teams provide valuable and highly relevant knowledge.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Better User Experience</strong></h3>",
    "<p>An extremely important added value of integrating the organization’s website with Cloud CRM is an improved user experience. A better user experience increases the satisfaction level of potential customers who are exposed for the first time to a dynamic, user-friendly website, as well as existing customers who receive convenient access from one place to all questions, requests, correspondence, related downloads, and updated information tailored to their needs.</p>",
    "<h2>Example: Request for Additional Product Information by Website Visitors</h2>",
    "<p>To illustrate the immense added value of integrating a website with mobile-adapted Cloud CRM, let’s take an example from everyday business life:</p>",
    "<p>Potential customers are searching for a solution your company provides and reach your website, which is connected through detailed contact forms to your Cloud CRM system. The required fields for submission are: contact person, role, company, number of employees, industry, phone, and email.</p>",
    "<p>It turns out that among the interested parties are two VPs of two large organizations urgently seeking information, two CEOs of companies in fields requiring more complex solutions, and one customer you’ve already been in touch with previously.</p>",
    "<p>The CRM system allows automatic real-time routing of relevant inquiries to the right sales representatives:</p>",
    "<p>a. Large companies receive an immediate response from an enterprise sales representative or senior manager, who can present the solution professionally (even if currently out in the field).</p>",
    "<p>b. CEOs with more complex customization requests are directed to more technically experienced representatives, while the CRM can retrieve from the company’s knowledge base whether similar cases occurred and how they were handled.</p>",
    "<p>c. The customer who has previously been in contact with the company is routed to a sales representative who can view the full real-time history of interactions, enabling a more strategic approach to closing the deal.</p>",
    "<p>If these leads had arrived via email in the usual way, the effectiveness of the response would undoubtedly have dropped significantly, reducing the likelihood of successful deal closures.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion:</h2>",
    "<p>Integrating your website with a Cloud CRM system greatly enhances the organization’s marketing and service capabilities by: preventing the loss of important leads, automating and streamlining marketing, measuring ROI at high resolution, maximizing sales to potential customers, providing more effective support, granting access to knowledge centers, and delivering a better user experience - which in today’s era is the name of the game.</p>"

    "<p>The primary purpose of a CRM system has always been and remains managing customer relationships in terms of sales, service, and marketing. Among the main needs addressed by the system are: in sales – managing automated processes to increase sales, in marketing – effective management and control of marketing campaigns, and in service – streamlining support and improving customer satisfaction.</p>",
    "<p>These needs have always existed, but the trends of the current era allow them to be addressed in a much more precise and intelligent way. In this article, I will discuss the great added value of the social sharing trend, which has significantly upgraded the CRM solution and even created an enhanced customer relationship management system called “Social CRM.”</p>",
    "<h2>What is Social CRM (Social Customer Relationship Management)?</h2>",
    "<p>Unlike traditional CRM, which manages the customer “from the outside” and provides insights for negotiations and price quotes based on data and preference analysis, Social CRM creates direct “one-on-one” interaction with the customer. In other words, Social CRM intelligently integrates social dialogue with customer relationship management, enabling systematic tracking of queries, suggestions, and complaints at a high resolution.</p>",
    "<p>The main added value of Social CRM is improved management of the customer experience, which allows for:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>Integrating all digital interactions and responding in real time through social platforms for marketing messages and as a means of providing service.</li>",
    "<li>Monitoring important marketing information through messages shared on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<h2>What is the Contribution of SCRM to Customer Service and Actual Sales?</h2>",
    "<p>The contribution of Social CRM is enormous when it comes to customer service and actual sales.</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li>The ability to gain high-resolution insights (through online monitoring) into customer opinions about products, services, and the market environment enables more effective and accurate adjustments to maximize sales volume and service quality.</li>",
    "<li>Direct dialogue with customers on their preferred platform creates a better user experience, improves satisfaction, and strengthens customer loyalty.</li>",
    "<li>Rapid response through SCRM to potential and existing customers’ questions or issues dramatically upgrades customer service (communication occurs within the social network where the customer “lives”).</li>",
    "<li>“Proactive social listening” via Social CRM allows for quickly identifying customer pain points at the right time, reducing churn.</li>",
    "<li>The accumulated high-resolution knowledge about customers through networks and direct dialogue generates smarter and more accurate reports, enabling more effective marketing initiatives.</li>",
    "<li>The ability to offer rewards and incentives to fans, loyal customers, and positive advocates strengthens the brand of the company and/or its products.</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<h2>How to Properly Implement Effective Social CRM for Your Organization?</h2>",
    "<h3><strong>Select an Advanced, User-Friendly Social CRM System</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Make sure to choose a customer relationship management system that is simple and easy to operate. Ensure the system includes smart sharing components that enable fast and effective interaction with potential and existing customers via popular social networks. It is recommended to work with cloud-based technologies to act and respond from anywhere, in real time.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Appoint Community Managers as Dedicated Organizational Functions</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Recruit or assign skilled personnel to manage the social communities. Entrust them with the responsibility of professionally managing online engagement, including monitoring information and documenting it in the CRM system. Allow them to focus solely on this important task, which requires significant attention, and conduct audits to increase productivity.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Build Customer Profiles and Document Them in the CRM</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Continuously monitor information about potential and existing customers on social networks and enrich the existing data profiles in the CRM system. This information is crucial for understanding customer processes – it is very important to document it frequently.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Take Initiative to Prevent Complaints</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Do not wait to “stumble upon” problems raised on social networks. Be proactive by taking initiative in dealing with complaints and engaging customers with FAQs. Share in advance any process improvements you are making to qualitatively upgrade your products.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Engage with Customers on Their Social Network and at Their Preferred Time</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Connect with customers at the right time and on the social platform where they are most active, whether Facebook, LinkedIn, or any other. Provide them with optimal user experience conditions so they feel they are operating in “their own arena,” maximizing satisfaction.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Respond in Real Time – Otherwise It Has No Value!</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Working online requires rapid responses. Not only is a delayed response less valuable, but it can also harm the organization’s reputation (especially in terms of service). One of the key goals of community managers is to instill an online work culture that, together with Social CRM, can dramatically improve customer satisfaction.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Focus Mainly on Legitimate Complaints</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Complaints and trolls are an inseparable part of social media interactions. Focus more on legitimate complaints and less on meaningless responses. Legitimate complaints represent real issues troubling your customers, and ignoring them may cause long-term damage.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Encourage Participation with Contests and a Rewards System</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Fans and supporters of your company on social media are a valuable asset: they contribute to product improvements by sharing their feelings, they recommend the company, and they feel more connected to it. Therefore, it is important to encourage their activity through engaging contests and by establishing a system of incentives and rewards that will keep the dialogue “alive and ongoing.”</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Share Interesting and Valuable Content</strong></h3>",
    "<p>The insights derived from feedback and high-resolution collaborative dialogue with customers can also be interesting and valuable for other customers. Share these insights and tips with relevant audiences. This will add value, strengthen your company’s positioning, and improve loyalty over time.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Run Targeted Campaigns Through the CRM</strong></h3>",
    "<p>The collaborative online dialogue and the ability to profile customers at a higher resolution using CRM will allow you to execute targeted and focused campaigns. These publications will likely have higher conversion rates to actual deals. The entire profit is yours…</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Make Sure to Collect Customer Feedback</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Customer feedback today is extremely important. Social CRM has an excellent infrastructure for conducting smart and accurate surveys, providing essential information about customer perceptions. This information leads to necessary adjustments and improvements, raising satisfaction and loyalty.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion:</h2>",
    "<p>In today’s era of social networks, Social CRM is extremely important for customer service and for increasing the organization’s actual sales. Its contribution is expressed in: providing insights through customer monitoring on the web, direct dialogue that enhances user experience, improved response times, proactive social listening to identify problems, accumulated knowledge, and strengthening the company’s brand.</p>",
    "<p>To optimally implement Social CRM, you must: choose an advanced customer relationship management system (especially in the collaborative aspect), appoint dedicated community managers, emphasize building customer profiles, take initiative in preventing complaints, engage with customers at the right time and platform, respond in real time, focus on legitimate complaints, encourage participation through contests and a rewards system, share valuable content, execute targeted campaigns based on customer profiles, and consistently collect customer feedback.</p>"

      "content": [
    "<p>There is no need to elaborate on the development of eCommerce since the turn of the millennium. We all witness the impressive growth of digital sales driven by virtual stores. In my opinion, given the massive shift to mobile-based, real-time work from anywhere and the significant improvement in user experience, the future still lies ahead of us.</p>",
    "<p>The transition of businesses to virtual stores and the increase in sales from digital activity requires store owners to focus on their marketing processes: increasing the number of leads entering the store, improving conversion rates, maximizing transactions, and enhancing customer loyalty in this arena.</p>",
    "<p>In this article, I will present the growing trend of integrating CRM systems with eCommerce websites and their tremendous ability to improve business results.</p>",
    "<h2>eCommerce vs. Traditional Commerce</h2>",
    "<p>While traditional commerce is characterized by conventional sales involving negotiation (often prolonged), limited product presentation as requested by the customer, and processes dependent on salespeople, digital commerce operates entirely differently. Digital commerce is automated, includes fast and flat browsing, exposes buyers to multiple online purchasing options, provides instant product information, and drives real-time actions.</p>",
    "<p>As a result, the massive number of interactions with products and customers in eCommerce provides countless opportunities for monitoring and measurement. Processing this data enables businesses to dramatically leverage marketing effectiveness toward customers.</p>",
    "<h2>CRM Software – A Huge Contribution to eCommerce</h2>",
    "<p>A CRM system, especially cloud-based, significantly contributes to the efficiency of virtual stores and dramatically improves conversion rates into actual sales. Below are some key added values:</p>",
    "<h3><strong>High-Resolution Data Collection</strong></h3>",
    "<p>The large volume of interactions taking place on eCommerce sites generates enormous potential for collecting information on customer characteristics and needs, such as product interests, purchase frequency, complaints, product returns, and more. Documented in an advanced CRM system, this data provides high-resolution insights into customers and plays a vital role in generating business insights to maximize store revenues.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Optimization of Purchasing Processes</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Documenting customer actions allows store owners to closely understand customers’ purchasing processes and receive a real-time overview. With CRM, it is possible to see where processes run smoothly, where they stall, potential failures, and more. This collected data enables proper adjustments that support process optimization.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>In-Depth and Clear Reports as Needed</strong></h3>",
    "<p>A CRM system delivers essential reports on the activity of both potential and existing buyers in virtual stores. The data is displayed through graphs, charts, and smart dashboards, providing a quick, clear, and sharp picture of the various trends and processes taking place in the store. Report flexibility can address a wide range of needs, including operational aspects of the store, marketing insights (e.g., trends among different audience segments), and customer attributes (buying habits, repeat purchases, returns, etc.).</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Real-Time Collaboration and Decision-Making</strong></h3>",
    "<p>The high number of interactions, the many actions taking place (inquiries, purchases, cancellations), and the dynamics of virtual stores require fast decision-making by store managers. These needs are met perfectly by a smart, cloud-based CRM system that enables online collaboration and brainstorming between sales representatives and management, to make necessary adjustments, provide better customer service, and improve satisfaction and loyalty.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Effective Task Management</strong></h3>",
    "<p>eCommerce is a real and growing business. Like any business, managing a virtual store involves tasks and responsibilities for back-office teams, sales representatives, and managers. A CRM system, which inherently manages, monitors, and controls tasks for sales and service teams, provides excellent solutions here as well. It assists in managing all sales and post-sales service processes, monitoring completed tasks, balancing bottlenecks through optimal workload distribution, and handling other essential needs.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Improving Customer Experience</strong></h3>",
    "<p>A CRM system significantly improves the customer experience. The accumulated marketing data in the system provides highly detailed insights on each customer. This information allows store management to improve store design, content strategy, purchase flow, sales tactics (including upselling and cross-selling), and especially support and service during and after purchases.</p>",
    "<h3><strong>Boosting Sales through Active Marketing</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Every virtual store requires online marketing to attract new potential buyers and increase sales among existing customers. A CRM system supports this in two main ways:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>Segmentation of potential customers (who showed interest but did not purchase) and existing customers. Segmentation can be based on various attributes entered into the system, allowing in some CRM platforms to reach high-resolution, precise audiences for tailored marketing messages.</li>",
    "<li>Sending marketing messages and newsletters directly from the system, drastically shortening timelines and maximizing marketing efforts.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<h3><strong>Reducing Frustrations and Increasing Loyalty</strong></h3>",
    "<p>Another critical factor for any virtual store is reducing frustrations and increasing satisfaction. A CRM system helps identify underperforming representatives, specific products that customers complain about and return, frustrating processes in store operations, poor service, and more. Preventing these failures improves customer satisfaction and strengthens loyalty.</p>",
    "<h2>eCommerce CRM – A Growing Trend</h2>",
    "<p>The massive growth of virtual stores and the enormous contribution of CRM systems to eCommerce indicate the next big thing: eCommerce CRM – a single platform that harmoniously integrates both systems. This platform has high added value due to its ability to work on a unified data source, creating efficiency and speed. Moreover, since eCommerce serves as a self-service system for customers, integration further enhances added value. An integrated system provides a superior user experience by displaying both CRM and commerce data from a single shared base.</p>",
    "<p>That said, some businesses may still prefer managing these processes via two connected but separate systems for their own reasons.</p>",
    "<h2>Conclusion:</h2>",
    "<p>A CRM system contributes enormously to eCommerce, whether operating as two connected but separate systems or on a single integrated platform.</p>",
    "<p>The advantages of integration include: <strong>high-resolution data collection, purchasing process optimization, in-depth and clear reports as needed, real-time collaboration and decision-making, effective task management, improved customer experience, and boosted sales through active marketing.</strong></p>"

      "title": "Which Sales Tactic Will Convince More Customers to Buy Your Product?",
      "content": [
      "<p>Being a salesperson, in my opinion, is both a craft and an art. Before I explain what I mean, I would like to remind you of the difference between these two concepts. The term 'craft' refers to work or trade performed by professionals who are experts in their field, while the term 'art' refers to an action carried out without a fixed and defined pattern, relying on the creativity of the performer.</p>",
      "<p>So why is a salesperson both a craftsman and an artist? Because on one hand, a salesperson today is a professional in every sense, specializing in sales, and on the other hand, they must be highly creative, applying smart tactics and thinking outside the box.</p>",
      "<p>In this article, I will highlight the importance of breaking away from the fixed, templated method of selling to a customer and instead using a creative tactic that generates interest and motivates the potential customer to move forward toward closing a deal.</p>",
      "<h2>Template Sales Bore the Customer</h2>",
      "<p>Even today, we still often encounter the continued use of template sales, which include: presenting product features and leveraging capabilities, boasting about its amazing advantages compared to competing products in the market, emphasizing the strength of the brand, and the stability of the company. While this sales tactic can occasionally find a receptive audience and drive deals, overall it has become rather boring for customers who hear it repeatedly from various salespeople.</p>",
      "<p>In contrast, a more creative tactic will capture far more attentive ears and allow salespeople to move forward toward closing more deals. One such tactic, based on 'success stories' and proven to deliver impressive results, is what I will expand on below.</p>",
      "<h2>Success Stories – A Winning Tactic!</h2>",
      "<p>People, in general, are drawn to stories, especially when those stories contain elements that resonate with their own lives. Similarly, your customers will be more interested in hearing a success story about the product or solution you want to sell them-one that solved a problem and contributed to the success of another company. This will undoubtedly influence them much more strongly than hearing once again how 'great and powerful' you are and seeing product features and stats…</p>",
      "<p>In fact, there are several reasons why the 'success stories' tactic is so powerful:</p>",
      "<h3><strong>The Tendency to Remember Stories More Than Presentations</strong></h3>",
      "<p>Customers tend to remember stories far more than presentations. Ask yourself, what influenced you more: a real client story that spoke to your needs, or a presentation of solution features and data? Think about it, and you’ll likely reach the same conclusion: a well-delivered success story does the job-big time!</p>",
      "<h3><strong>People Love to Learn From Success</strong></h3>",
      "<p>People, and especially managers, love learning from success stories of companies and successful CEOs. A success story that also includes similar needs and challenges, to which your product or solution provided an effective answer, will certainly earn serious attention and may even advance you significantly toward closing the deal.</p>",
      "<h3><strong>The Most Convincing Showcase of Added Value to the Customer</strong></h3>",
      "<p>There is no doubt that a real-world example is the most convincing way to demonstrate the added value of your solution to an interested customer. Presenting impressive features, excellent data, and emphasizing that your product is a market leader is nice. But with all due respect, nothing beats showing in real time how your product or solution solved a company’s problem and dramatically improved its effectiveness. Facts cannot be argued with-numbers and data can…</p>",
      "<h2>Tips for Using the 'Success Stories' Tactic</h2>",
      "<ol><li><h3>Focus on the Customers’ Success, Not on Yourselves</h3></li></ol>",
      "<p>When sharing a success story with your customers, try not to put the 'spotlight' on you and your product, but rather on the customer’s success achieved through your product. Remember: your customers care most about their own success, so presenting how another company succeeded thanks to your solution is what will drive them to close the deal with you.</p>",
      "<ol start=\"2\"><li><h3>Include the Customer’s Pain Points</h3></li></ol>",
      "<p>It is very important that your success story includes problems similar to those your customers face. A story that includes these pain points will naturally resonate much more with potential customers. Their decision-making process will be much closer to 'clear-cut,' since the story shows how a company with similar needs purchased your product and successfully leveraged it.</p>",
      "<ol start=\"3\"><li><h3>One Significant Story, Not Many</h3></li></ol>",
      "<p>You don’t need to overwhelm your customers with multiple success stories-it can be tiring. It’s better to focus on one real, recent story that is highly relevant to your target customers. It shouldn’t be too long or exhausting. The story should spark interest and create identification by highlighting the key points customers want to hear about.</p>",
      "<ol start=\"4\"><li><h3>Consistency Across Sales Representatives</h3></li></ol>",
      "<p>If you’re working with multiple salespeople handling sales processes in different markets, it’s very important that the popular success stories remain consistent. If each representative tells the same story with a different twist, it could spread and harm the company’s credibility. It’s always better to align versions in team meetings and present one unified, winning story.</p>",
      "<h2>In Conclusion:</h2>",
      "<p>Template sales, consisting only of presenting features and data, boasting about brand power, and the company’s market leadership, are too monotonous and bore the customer. It is highly recommended to use the winning tactic of success stories, because customers tend to remember stories more than presentations, people love to learn from success, and this is the most convincing way to showcase the product’s value.</p>",
      "<p>To apply the success story tactic wisely, focus on the customers who succeeded (not on yourself), include pain points relevant to the client, tell one meaningful story (not more)…</p>"

      "content": [
      "<p>CRM and ERP are undoubtedly the most popular core systems for managing the daily operations of organizations, companies, and businesses. In a previous article of mine on the Skyz Blog",
      " <a href=\"http://skyzblog.co.il/erp-%D7%95-crm-%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%91%D7%93%D7%9C-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99-%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%A8/\">",
      "<strong>ERP and CRM: What’s the Difference Between the Systems and Which is More Important</strong>",
      "</a>",
      "<b>?</b>&nbsp; I described in detail the role of each system and outlined the general differences between them.",
      "</p>",
      "<p>In this article, I would like to shed light on a specific and crucial aspect of future order forecasting, describe the contribution of each system to this area, and present the significant advantage of using CRM system data for better forecasting that will help maximize sales and revenue.",
      "</p>",
      "<h2>The Added Value of ERP for Order Forecasting</h2>",
      "<p>The ERP system shows us the orders that have been placed and the actual inventory of products. Through the system, we can see how many products were sold from inventory overall and which items were sold to specific customers.</p>",
      "<p>The information we receive from the ERP system is essentially fairly passive. It can indicate general demand for popular products and items sold less frequently compared to others.</p>",
      "<h2>The Contribution of CRM to Order Forecasting</h2>",
      "<p>An advanced CRM system, updated in high resolution by marketing and sales personnel and professionally managed, allows us to forecast future orders of the company’s products on an overall level, by segment, and per customer, while taking into account personal and marketing aspects.</p>",
      "<p>The system can indicate potential future orders from existing customers or target customers, based on analyzing characteristics of other customers who purchased the same product, according to the history of interactions and significant information we received from them.</p>",
      "<p>Another finding that can be revealed through in-depth CRM analysis is the order growth rate of certain companies, which points to customers with high potential for future orders.</p>",
      "<p><strong>Why is it smarter to forecast future orders using CRM?</strong></p>",
      "<h2>Information Accessibility for the Salesperson</h2>",
      "<p>ERP system order data is valuable, but it does not provide the real-time needs of salespeople. When a salesperson communicates with an existing or potential customer, it is highly desirable that they have immediate access to critical data.</p>",
      "<p>CRM systems, which are primarily implemented in marketing, sales, and service departments, turn the salesperson into an active user of the system in every sense. They update, get updated, can generate reports, and receive a real-time status overview, which greatly helps them forecast future orders effectively, since they live and breathe the system.</p>",
      "<h2>Super-Critical Real-Time Information (Including Upsells)</h2>",
      "<p>The data regarding future orders generated by a CRM system is broader and more crucial than what exists in an ERP system.</p>",
      "<p>While ERP provides data on the quantity of products sold from inventory, including the ability to link them to customers, CRM can generate more extensive data and reports based on customer interaction history, shared characteristics, marketing analyses by segments, and more.</p>",
      "<p>The CRM system also allows us to forecast sales of complementary products, thereby helping predict expanded sales to the customer.</p>",
      "<h2>Smart Forecasting for Specific Needs</h2>",
      "<p>Often, we need to receive a specific forecast for the orders of a particular product (e.g., the company’s flagship product). A more detailed forecast can be obtained through the CRM system, which enables us to analyze, review customer history, and generate reports from various perspectives.</p>",
      "<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>",
      "<p>An organization selling workshops and courses to the business sector wants to forecast sales of a course on an older graphic software. CRM has significant added value for forecasting future orders beyond simply retrieving data on last year’s course sales. Indeed, analysis of customer history shows difficulties in selling the course due to the introduction of new software in the market, as well as that those who primarily purchased it were long-time design professionals. These insights can certainly add an important dimension to the sales forecast in the near future.</p>",
      "<h2>Customer Characteristic Analysis</h2>",
      "<p>Our ability to profile customers and document them in CRM, compared to ERP, is highly important for forecasting future orders. Characteristics allow us to predict orders from potential or existing customers with shared attributes, generating information essential for improving order forecasts.</p>",
      "<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>",
      "<p>A company selling bicycles identifies, by analyzing its customer base through the organization’s CRM system, double-digit growth in sales of mountain bikes among young managers in organizations in northern Israel. Whereas ERP could only show a general trend, CRM enables us to make far more accurate sales forecasts by analyzing the common denominator of specific target audiences.</p>",
      "<h2>Understanding Emerging Trends</h2>",
      "<p>CRM is very helpful in understanding emerging trends based on the extensive information collected about existing and potential customers. The ability to clearly examine the sales funnel, perform high-resolution analyses of customers or audiences, and draw insights from historical activity allows us to identify emerging trends in future orders.</p>",
      "<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>",
      "<p>An organization selling IT equipment to the business sector discovers through customer history analysis that order rates from startups in advanced stages (operating for more than a year) are growing much faster (over 25%) compared to other clients. This analysis provides management with insight that such a stage for this type of business creates a rapid growth trend, which directly impacts increased future orders in the near term.</p>",
      "<h2>Integration with Marketing Automation</h2>",
      "<p>The ability to forecast orders using CRM is not only better in terms of data and analysis but also in enabling automated actions based on the findings. In other words, the response to the forecast is fast, effective, and significantly contributes to maximizing actual orders.</p>",
      "<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>",
      "<p>A company selling laptops via direct marketing identifies, through customer characteristics and history analysis, growth in sales of small and compact laptops among CEOs (from existing customers) of international businesses operating mainly abroad. These findings enable the company, through CRM, not only to forecast orders from this customer segment but also to automatically send a targeted marketing message offering a new compact model to this defined audience. This action boosts actual orders!</p>",
      "<h2><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>",
      "<p>Sales forecasting using CRM provides much greater added value than forecasting with ERP. The added value lies in: accessibility of information to salespeople, super-critical real-time information (including upsells), smart forecasting for specific needs, customer profiling, quick understanding of emerging trends, and operational response to forecasts through marketing automation.</p>"

      "content": [
    "<p>The field of marketing and advertising has been rapidly developing since the beginning of the current millennium. The establishment of the internet as a central platform, the massive growth in mobile usage (especially smartphones), and the increasing use of social media have dramatically influenced strategies and tactics in marketing and advertising, opened up a new world for us, and introduced new terminology into the field.</p>",
    "<p>In this article, I will highlight important terms belonging to the world of marketing and advertising, including both essential traditional terms and those that belong to the new era, which we must be familiar with.</p>",
    "<h2>A/B Testing</h2>",
    "<p>The term A/B testing refers to the examination of two advertising versions (usually an active marketing email) to understand which one delivers better results. The variations may differ in the actual advertising content, subject line, call-to-action, and so on. The insights will allow you to create more effective advertising that generates more leads for actual deals.</p>",
    "<p>Example:</p>",
    "<p>A company marketing a business course wanted to run a digital direct mail campaign using an email list from a certain business media outlet. To test the effectiveness of the advertising concept, the marketing team split the first campaign for the business course into two parts, each with a different subject line and message concept. Indeed, the results showed that one part generated three times more effective results than the other. This insight allowed the marketing team to understand how to advertise more effectively in future campaigns for this audience.</p>",
    "<h2>B2B Marketing</h2>",
    "<p>The term B2B marketing refers to businesses that market products and/or services and/or solutions to businesses, companies, and organizations (and not to private consumers). This type of marketing involves more complex sales, often requiring multiple decision-makers or management members to be involved in the purchasing process.</p>",
    "<p>Characteristics and tips for B2B marketing:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>Products, services, and solutions (even complex ones) sold to businesses, companies, and organizations in the business sector</li>",
    "<li>Sales processes often involve multiple decision-makers within the purchasing organization</li>",
    "<li>Closing deals often takes longer compared to B2C sales to private consumers</li>",
    "<li>The target audience requires a professional marketing process and presentation of added value</li>",
    "<li>It is recommended to manage B2B marketing through an advanced CRM system</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p>Examples of B2B products:</p>",
    "<p>Software solutions, inputs, construction components for contractors, and so on</p>",
    "<h2>B2C Marketing (Business to Customer Marketing)</h2>",
    "<p>The term B2C marketing refers to businesses that market products and/or services and/or solutions to private consumers (not businesses). This type of marketing usually generates faster sales processes based more on emotional decision-making and the way the product is perceived by customers.</p>",
    "<p>Characteristics and tips for B2C marketing:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>Products, services, and solutions sold to private consumers</li>",
    "<li>Faster sales processes (in most cases) and more emotion-driven compared to B2B</li>",
    "<li>Strong emphasis on the customer’s perception of the product and the selling company in terms of positioning</li>",
    "<li>A sharp shift in the new era toward digital store sales (e-commerce)</li>",

    "</ul>",
    "<p>Examples of B2C products:</p>",
    "<p>Fashion, home goods, live shows, and more</p>",
    "<h2>Click-Through Rate (CTR)</h2>",
    "<p>The term Click-Through Rate (CTR) is a metric that expresses, in percentages, the ratio between the number of ad impressions received online and the number of clicks generated from those impressions. The importance of this metric lies in the insights gained about user responses to the advertising messages presented during online campaigns.</p>",
    "<p>Example:</p>",
    "<p>If the number of impressions for a banner advertising computer screens is 1,000, and the number of clicks is 30, then the CTR is 3%.</p>",
    "<p>Characteristics and tips for CTR:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>A high CTR indicates that the ad succeeded in generating interest among users</li>",
    "<li>Ad effectiveness is not determined solely by a high CTR. Paradoxically, a lower CTR that generates more effective leads may result in more actual deals</li>",
    "<li>Proper CTR analysis requires examining the effectiveness of the clicks that led to sales-preferably done through an advanced CRM system</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<h2>Conversion Rate</h2>",
    "<p>The marketing term Conversion Rate is a metric that expresses the percentage of website, minisite, or landing page visitors who proceeded to take an action such as registering for more information, scheduling a meeting, or purchasing a product (based on the advertisers’ defined goals).</p>",
    "<p>Example:</p>",
    "<p>A construction company that built a new office building and wanted to attract new tenants set up a minisite for the project with a form for more information. If 2,000 visitors entered the site and 160 filled out the inquiry form, the conversion rate was 8%.</p>",
    "<p>Characteristics and tips for Conversion Rate:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>A high conversion rate indicates an attractive product and/or smart website design and/or effective calls-to-action</li>",
    "<li>Improving conversion rate requires marketing analysis, data evaluation, and adjustments</li>",
    "<li>It is advisable to collect and analyze data related to conversion rates through an advanced CRM system</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<h2>Corporate Identity</h2>",
    "<p>The term Corporate Identity refers to how a business, company, or organization presents itself to customers, suppliers, employees, and the public. Corporate identity is one of the most important processes within a company’s marketing strategy and includes actions such as logo design, slogans, publications, product and store/office design, business correspondence, website, public relations, and any marketing activity that contributes to the company’s image.</p>",
    "<p>Characteristics and tips for Corporate Identity:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>Corporate identity is not limited to logo design and websites/marketing materials but includes the entire spectrum of communication touchpoints with the public</li>",
    "<li>Proper investment in corporate identity enhances consumer confidence in choosing the company’s products</li>",
    "<li>Creating corporate identity is an important process best carried out by experienced marketing experts</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<h2>Landing Page</h2>",
    "<p>The term Landing Page refers to an online advertising page with a short, strong message that drives action (usually by filling and submitting a digital form).

The role of TOFU is to reach and attract as many potential customers as possible to the company’s products through marketing activities such as advertising, active mail campaigns, SEO, social media use, and more.</p>",
    "<p>Characteristics and tips for TOFU:</p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>Plan smart, precise advertising activities to attract genuine prospects (and not waste time on irrelevant ones)</li>",
    "<li>Use a wide range of advertising platforms to reach every potential prospect based on their habits (print, digital, social media, etc.)</li>",
    "<li>Manage the funnel effectively using an advanced CRM system to enable analysis and required adjustments</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<h2>Market Segmentation</h2>",
    "<p>The term Market Segmentation refers to dividing the customer market into groups based on shared characteristics in order to maximize precise and effective marketing messages. Segmentation is performed based on defined strategic objectives, with the option to cut across various factors such as geographic location, age, gender, interests, customer type (private, business, government), and more. Market segmentation is relevant to all advertising platforms: print, digital, mobile, social, passive, active.</p>",

      "title": "Sales Management Software: What Are the Most Important Metrics to Maximize Actual Effectiveness?",
      "content": [
  "<p>Sales management software is one of the most important and essential tools for improving sales processes and meeting predetermined deal quotas.",
  "<strong>This software, which typically serves as a core component of",
  "</strong>",
  "<strong>CRM",
  "</strong>",
  "<strong> systems,",
  "</strong> enables ongoing and high-resolution measurement of sales activities and performance across different aspects in order to gain valuable insights for improvements and adjustments.",
  "</p>",
  "<p>In this article, I will outline the key metrics and data points you should focus on when using sales management (CRM) software to generate real added value and improve actual results.",
  "</p>",
  "<h2>Close Rate Sales</h2>",
  "<p>The close rate is a simple yet extremely important metric for sales activity. This metric refers to the ratio of closing potential leads into actual deals. Close rates can range from just a few percent to dozens of percent, depending on the type of products, the industry, market environment (competitors), and local and global trends.</p>",
  "<p>To improve the close rate in your company, it is recommended to calculate your current average close rate (taking into account the industry you operate in) and set a benchmark. If you notice a significant decline in this metric, you should investigate the reasons, make the necessary adjustments, and increase the close rate at least back to the benchmark level (while aiming for more).</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Example:</strong></h3>",
  "<p>For example, consider a company that sells UPS systems with its main market being the business sector in Israel. If the average close rate is 25% from potential leads (for this example), but in the last winter, which is the peak season, the close rate dropped to 10%, this should immediately raise a red flag for the managers.</p>",
  "<p>They must investigate the reasons for the decline: Was it an exogenous factor such as weather changes? Was there a flaw in the sales process? Was the sales team underperforming? Was the sales management system too cumbersome, slowing down the process? In this case, the reason turned out to be a drought year, which significantly reduced purchases since potential customers preferred to take the risk rather than invest in systems that protect against lightning and power outages.</p>",
  "<p>This quick insight reassured the managers that the decline was not due to internal sales process failures but to an external temporary issue.</p>",
  "<h2>Close Time Sales</h2>",
  "<p>Close time refers to the exact amount of time it takes to close a sale with a customer. This metric provides insights into the effectiveness of sales processes and the evolution of market trends. Excessively long close times can prevent the sales department from meeting quotas and harm the organization’s revenue generation and cash flow.</p>",
  "<p>To shorten close times, it is highly recommended to use a sales management system with robust capabilities, enabling you to generate reports by sales reps, products, geographic segments, etc., analyze data intelligently, and gain insights into delays, bottlenecks, and failures within the processes.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Example:</strong></h3>",
  "<p>For example, consider a car company selling a specific brand of European vehicles, where the average close time from lead entry (or a new visitor at the showroom) to closing the sale is 45 days. If the managers discovered via their sales management system that the close time increased to an average of 70 days, they must quickly analyze why this occurred.</p>",
  "<p>The company should ask: Are the latest models less attractive to consumers, requiring more time to decide? Have competitors introduced more appealing models that confuse customers and delay decisions? Is the problem with new sales staff? Or is sales management simply not efficient enough?</p>",
  "<p>In this case, managers discovered that competitors had very attractive models, forcing the company to invest in smarter sales strategies and incentives to shorten close times.</p>",
  "<h2>Close Source Sales</h2>",
  "<p>Close source refers to the lead source from which the sale originated and eventually closed. Sales management software should provide a complete picture of close sources to help you understand which media or marketing channels are most effective in generating leads that convert into actual deals.</p>",
  "<p>Data about close sources allows you to optimize the advertising and sales channels you use, generating more effective leads that convert into real deals.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Example:</strong></h3>",
  "<p>Consider a company that sells management workshops to business decision-makers. Their marketing activities include outbound telemarketing, paid search ads (AdWords), social media, and targeted email campaigns.</p>",
  "<p>If the company identifies through the software that targeted email campaigns produce excellent close data, social media and AdWords perform well, but telemarketing results are mediocre or worse, the company can shift more focus toward the better-performing sources while significantly reducing telemarketing. This would both improve sales effectiveness and save considerable manpower.</p>",
  "<h2>Win vs. Loss Rate</h2>",
  "<p>The win vs. loss rate measures the ratio of successes to failures in closing sales. A very low rate for a specific product may indicate an issue in the sales process or a developing market trend affecting the product.</p>",
  "<p>Working with intelligent sales management software will help you analyze losses in high detail and gain critical insights for improving close rates in the long term.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>",
  "<p>Consider a company that sells kitchens to end consumers. In the past six months, the win vs. loss rate dropped significantly, indicating a higher failure rate compared to the past.</p>",
  "<p>Through advanced analysis of customer history using the sales management software, decision-makers concluded that the decline was not due to sales process flaws or weak sales reps, but rather to a competitor’s new payment policy that made their offering less attractive.</p>",
  "<p>Now that the cause is clear, the company can adjust its payment terms and dramatically reduce failures.</p>",
  "<h2>Sales Funnel Analysis</h2>",
  "<p>Sales funnel analysis includes critical data and metrics for understanding sales processes accurately: How many leads are there and at which stage? Is the lead progression rate at each stage reasonable? Why are some leads “stuck”? Why have hot leads that became opportunities not yet closed?</p>",
  "<p>Funnel analysis provides a complete, high-resolution picture of the entire process from incoming leads to actual closures, significantly helping to identify failures and make improvements.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>",
  "<p>Consider a company selling project management software to businesses. Over a long period, the conversion rate from incoming leads to actual deals has been very low. To improve results, the company must identify the weak link in its sales process.</p>",
  "<p>In this case, proper funnel analysis revealed that the conversion from leads to opportunities was very low, while the conversion from opportunities to actual sales was excellent. This clearly showed that many incoming leads were irrelevant, likely due to unclear advertising messages.</p>",
  "<p>Now with a clear picture, the company’s marketing team can refine its messaging to generate more relevant, effective leads.</p>",
  "<h2>Planning vs. Performance</h2>",
  "<p>This metric compares planned sales quotas for reps against their actual performance. It usually indicates sales reps’ effectiveness at the individual or departmental level but can also reflect external and internal factors influencing actual sales closures.</p>",
  "<p>The measurement data provides a benchmark of sales performance compared to the goals defined in the marketing plan. Large gaps between planning and execution yield valuable insights for future improvements.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Example:</strong></h3>",
  "<p>Consider a company selling outdoor furniture nationwide through three sales centers: north, center, and south. A yearly sales plan was created for all branches, accounting for variables and building a reasonable sales forecast. In the first and second quarters, performance matched the plan, but in the third quarter, there was a drop of more than 20% compared to the target.</p>",
  "<p>This is where the planning vs. performance metric comes into play, allowing analysis at the branch and individual level. A more detailed analysis revealed that the decline was due to very low close rates in the north, as the key sales rep there was underperforming due to personal reasons.</p>",
  "<p>This insight prompted management to hold a clarifying meeting with the rep, restore his motivation, and bring his sales performance back up to previous levels and beyond.</p>",
  "<h2>Customer Loyalty</h2>",
  "<p>Customer loyalty is measured by monitoring existing customers’ level of activity in terms of purchasing additional or complementary services and products from the same company on a regular basis. Loyal customers tend to purchase support, services, and products frequently compared to others who feel comfortable switching to competitors without hesitation.</p>",
  "<p>Measurement data will provide an overview of overall customer loyalty, key insights into loyal customer characteristics, declines in repeat purchases, customer churn, and more.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Example:</strong></h3>",
  "<p>Consider a company that sells office supplies directly to businesses. Over the past year, there has been a decline of about 15% in repeat purchases of additional and complementary products.</p>",
  "<p>Sales management software activity analysis provided very important insights:</p>",
  "<ol>",
  "<li>Among large clients, repeat purchases did not decline and even increased slightly.</li>",
  "<li>Among small businesses, there was a significant and growing decline.</li>",
  "<li>Sales reps maintained ongoing contact only with large clients who brought in more revenue.</li>",
  "</ol>",
  "<p>These insights painted a clear picture: small clients were receiving no special attention and thus felt no need to stay loyal, especially with the rise of online shopping. The conclusion: launch a loyalty program for small businesses including substantial discounts, and develop more active upselling and cross-selling efforts.</p>",
  "<h2>Conclusion:</h2>",
  "<p>If you are planning to purchase sales management software or upgrade your existing one, ensure that it includes these metrics and data: close rate, close time, close source, win vs. loss rate, sales funnel analysis, planning vs. performance, and customer loyalty. Advanced software that integrates these metrics and data will dramatically improve your results.</p>"

  "</strong>",
  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>Below I will expand on the significant added value of cloud-based, mobile-adapted CRM for dramatically improving the customer experience:</p>",
  "<h2>Immediate Availability for Service Requests (Service Availability)</h2>",
  "<p>One of the most frustrating things for customers in service is the unavailability of support representatives. It is clear that organizations try to cut down on service agents as much as possible to increase profitability, but the price they pay can be high, due to the damage to the customer experience - up to long-term customer attrition.</p>",
  "<p>Cloud-based service management or CRM systems can dramatically improve your service representatives’ availability by adding “support power” from field staff as well. If until now only office-based customer service agents documented service calls, now with cloud CRM, any field agent can use their smartphone to log calls and provide initial real-time responses.</p>",
  "<h2>Efficient Routing for Optimal Support (Optimal Support)</h2>",
  "<p>The service department, which supports customers on an ongoing basis, often receives calls that require more professional responses than the support reps can provide. Moreover, in certain service events, it is preferable to transfer the call to a specific rep who knows the customer, gets along with them better, and can provide an effective response quickly.</p>",
  "<p>This process of routing for optimal support can be carried out efficiently using cloud-based, mobile-compatible service software or CRM. With real-time access to customer information from anywhere, the call can be routed to the right rep for fast, professional handling.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>",
  "<p>A service department in an IT maintenance organization receives an urgent call from a strategic client about a complex problem that only two senior technicians can handle. Both are currently working in the field…</p>",
  "<p>With advanced cloud-based CRM managing the service, urgent calls are routed directly to these field technicians, who, using customer data management capabilities on the go, are able to resolve the issue quickly and efficiently.</p>",
  "<p>This approach keeps strategic customers satisfied with the service level and strengthens their future loyalty to the organization.</p>",
  "<h2>Comprehensive Customer View from the Field</h2>",
  "<p>Customer service is a highly dynamic field requiring close management at any given time. Customers, especially in today’s fast-paced era, want effective real-time support. Management teams must always have their “finger on the pulse,” monitoring service processes, staff performance, tasks, and event handling.</p>",
  "<p>A cloud-based, mobile-compatible CRM system provides managers with a perfect solution for managing, monitoring, and controlling customer service processes from anywhere in real time. A system like",
  "<a href=\"http://www.skyz.co.il/skyzcrm-%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%9C-%D7%A7%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA/skyzservice/\">",
  "<strong>Skyz Service",
  "</strong>",
  "</a> enables you to receive up-to-date insights regarding service requests and processes, how reps are handling them, and prevent delays, errors, or failures that could be costly for the organization.</p>",
  "<h2>Quick Retrieval of Solutions from a Knowledge Base</h2>",
  "<p>Knowledge is power - especially in customer service. When support reps encounter complex issues, personal knowledge is not always enough, and accumulated knowledge from past cases is required.</p>",
  "<p>This situation is best solved with cloud-based, mobile CRM systems. Logging events (with emphasis on problem-solution) by your support reps on an ongoing basis (easily done in the field with a smartphone) creates a highly valuable knowledge base for all support staff, allowing them to address any issue in real time.</p>",
  "<h2>Real-Time Sharing of Critical Information</h2>",
  "<p>Information sharing is a major added value, especially in field service. Many delays in providing solutions to customers occur due to missing critical information or documents required for the rep’s work process.</p>",
  "<p>An advanced cloud-based, mobile-compatible CRM can enable crucial sharing processes from anywhere, online. As a result, any rep visiting customers in the field has access to every file or document needed for service, whether on the way or at the customer’s site.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>",
  "<p>A service rep for restaurant refrigerators arrives to fix a fault but needs a supervisor’s signature on a specific technical document, which must then be filed in the customer record before closing the call. The CRM system’s sharing capabilities allow the service department secretary to instantly send the supervisor’s approval and file the document in the customer’s record online.</p>",
  "<p>This collaborative action eliminates delays and creates an orderly, fast, and professional process for closing the service call to the customer’s satisfaction.</p>",
  "<h2>Gaining Insights into Trends and Failures (Get Insights)</h2>",
  "<p>Understanding trends and failures in service processes - and deriving insights from them - is critical to improving service quality and customer experience. A cloud- and mobile-based CRM system can definitely help provide a clear and accurate picture.</p>",
  "<p>The high-resolution updates from both office and field reps supply real-time information on trends and raise red flags instantly when service response gaps or failures occur.</p>"

  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>Below I will expand on tips for smarter management of proactive sales.</p>",
  "<h2>Investing Time in Identifying the Target Audience (Target Audience)</h2>",
  "<p>Before carrying out a proactive sales marketing process for existing products, and especially for new products, invest in a smart analysis of the market and in accurately identifying target audiences. Often, when delving a little deeper, it becomes clear that certain population segments not initially expected as potential may turn into customers, and conversely, in audiences that seemed obvious as product consumers, irrelevant niches were found that are a waste of time.</p>",
  "<p>Accurate identification of target audiences begins with an investment in comprehensively understanding needs, which can be obtained through analysis and insights from existing customer use of the product, thinking about new use ideas, and examining local and global market trends. After gathering this information, it is advisable to hold a brainstorming session with sales and marketing staff to optimally and in high resolution define the potential audiences.</p>",
  "<h2>In-depth Study of Potential Customers (Potential Customers)</h2>",
  "<p>After correctly identifying target audiences and before making the first proactive contact, it is highly advisable to do your “homework” regarding potential customers. This “homework” is expressed in understanding the company’s specific business field, its needs related to the product or solution you are selling, and other important characteristics that will ‘equip’ your salespeople with essential and useful knowledge.</p>",
  "<p>In-depth study of potential customers will allow your sales representatives to give the potential customer the impression that you are well-versed in their field, to connect with them positively, and to wisely present the added value of your product or solution.</p>",
  "<p>Carrying out this study in practice is much easier in the modern era compared to the past. Search engines and social networks allow you to quickly monitor vital information, often even in real time. It is advisable that important information be updated in the organization’s CRM system, in order to create an up-to-date future knowledge base that will enable the entire team to retrieve information online from anywhere.</p>",
  "<h2>Choosing the Right Communication Method (Communication Way)</h2>",
  "<p>The modern era offers us a variety of communication methods with the customer: phone calls, face-to-face meetings, text messages, emails, WhatsApp messages, and activity through social networks. This variety turns communication that in the past was simple and based on calls and meetings into a type of tactic that can influence the sales process toward closing a deal.</p>",
  "<p>It is very important to plan the communication method in the initial stages according to the type of customer and the depth of knowledge you have gained about them. For example, if the customer is very active on social networks, you can communicate through that channel.</p>",
  "<p>Even in more advanced stages of the proactive sales process, it is crucial to use judgment. Sometimes preferring communication via emails or WhatsApp messages is better than phone calls, and conversely, some customers (such as older ones from previous generations) may prefer the warmth of a phone call over written correspondence. Your discretion according to the situation is super important!</p>",
  "<h2>Integrating an Awareness Campaign (Awareness Campaign)</h2>",
  "<p>When promoting a proactive initial sales process, it is very important to create strong awareness of the brand or solution you are about to present to customers. A background awareness campaign can certainly support sales representatives when performing a proactive action.</p>",
  "<p>There is no doubt that when proactive contact is made with a new customer who has already heard in the background about the product or brand the company is selling, it is much easier to overcome initial objections that could otherwise end the process from the start, especially if the customer has no patience for sales calls for any reason.</p>",
  "<h2>Working with an Advanced Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System</h2>",
  "<p>Effective sales management in the current era requires close work with an advanced customer relationship management system (preferably cloud-based). The system allows management and tracking of the sales process from its beginning through all stages until the deal is closed.</p>",
  "<p>A CRM system will greatly assist you in managing proactive sales by:</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>Accurate tracking capability of interactions – highly essential when it comes to new customers.</li>",
  "<li>Super important knowledge retrieved from an up-to-date database of cases and processes with similar customers.</li>",
  "<li>High-resolution analysis of customer characteristics that provide insights for the right approach to the customer.</li>",
  "<li>Automatic reminders to prevent “missed interactions” that are critical to the continuation of the “deal’s lifecycle.”</li>",
  "<li>Smart reports for learning trends, drawing conclusions, and making adjustments on both micro and macro levels.</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<h2>Documenting Customer Records at High Resolution (Customer Records)</h2>",
  "<p>It is highly recommended that sales representatives document in detail their interactions with the potential customer from the initial contact. This process requires the use of a smart information system in the modern era, the most recommended in my opinion being a mobile-compatible cloud-based CRM system.</p>",
  "<p>Detailed documentation of actions, comments, and notes will help you in two main aspects to ensure the success of proactive sales:</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>It will enable sales representatives at any given time to receive an accurate 360-degree overview of characteristics, current status, trends (at the micro level), issues, and potential keys to success in closing a future deal.</li>",
  "<li>It will contribute to the accumulated knowledge in the firm’s marketing database (structured in the CRM) for analyzing cumulative data and generating reports to obtain insights on the macro level.</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<h2>Identifying with Customer Needs and Building Common Ground (Customer Needs)</h2>",
  "<p>The key to creating a positive connection with the customer is building common ground and identifying with their needs, especially when it comes to an initial sales interaction. Customers are far more likely to connect with representatives who first empathize with them and not just try to sell to them. They become more attentive and are highly likely to continue in the process.</p>",
  "<p>It is highly advisable that already in the opening call, sales representatives dedicate initial effort to finding common ground with the customer before attempting to sell. Even at the stage of presenting the product, salespeople should emphasize identifying with the customer’s needs rather than only pushing for a sale. The customer’s success should be the main focus!</p>",
  "<h2>Presenting Product Cost at the Right Time (Product Cost)</h2>",
  "<p>One of the central issues in a proactive sales call, when the customer is still in the early stage, is when to present the product cost. Salespeople who are quite hesitant about this move often try to postpone it to later stages of the process out of fear of receiving a “not suitable” from the customer.</p>",
  "<p>However, in my opinion, the approach should be different. Sales representatives should present the product cost naturally at the right time “without apologizing.” The customer needs to feel that they will receive added value but that it will cost them. That’s valid and it sells!!</p>"

      "title": "A CRM System Will Boost Your Personalized Marketing!",
      "content": [
  "<p>One of the key moves in modern marketing is improving the customer experience. This key move is greatly supported by a CRM system, which, through its advanced capabilities, enables the leveraging of marketing, sales, and service activities in a personalized way.</p>",
  "<p>In this article, I will highlight the significant added value a CRM system provides for personalized marketing, with a special focus on the great contribution of: smart automation, 360° single-view control, advanced segmentation capabilities, and innovative sharing components that enhance the customer experience.</p>",
  "<h2>Smart Use of Automated Actions</h2>",
  "<p>Paradoxically, automated actions, which are often thought to be cold and annoying to the customer, can actually help greatly in enhancing the customer experience. An advanced CRM system can schedule essential marketing messages such as: welcome emails for new customers, ongoing important updates sent directly to mobile devices via SMS, thank-you messages after a purchase, and more.</p>",
  "<p>An advanced CRM system can allow you to create a workflow process that will automatically integrate important emails or SMS messages within a purchase process, a marketing campaign, a drop in customer business activity, and more.</p>",
  "<p>There is no doubt that this type of automation will not create alienation. On the contrary-the actions executed automatically and efficiently by the system (with no realistic way for employees to do them manually) will improve the customer experience and increase their satisfaction.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>",
  "<p>An organization that sells digital marketing courses wants to offer a bonus of “one-on-one work” with a renowned international expert in the field. However, this is only possible in the coming days and can be scheduled two hours before the start of the first lecture, three days in advance. The management automatically sends messages to course registrants, including the ability to schedule a specific time for a small-group personal meeting. This automated move creates a sense of satisfaction and a positive customer experience for the participants.</p>",
  "<h2>Sending Marketing Messages to a Segmented and Targeted Audience</h2>",
  "<p>The more marketing messages are aimed at a well-defined and targeted customer audience with high resolution, the more effective they will be in driving customer action. Targeted communication that addresses their real needs (as opposed to generic messages that only “annoy” them) is much more likely to generate significant interest in responding to the marketing message (whether via email or SMS), requesting more details, and ultimately making a purchase.</p>",
  "<p>A smart CRM system such as <a href=\"http://www.skyz.co.il/skyzcrm-%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%9C-%D7%A7%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA/skyzmarketing/%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%9C-%D7%A7%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D/\">Skyz CRM</a> provides highly advanced segmentation capabilities. Naturally, the more data you collect about your customers, the more precise your segmentation can be. When combined with sharp and clear messages, the customer receives a valuable marketing message that will significantly increase your conversion rates.</p>",
  "<h2>Personalized Communication for a One-on-One Feeling</h2>",
  "<p>The most important action in leveraging personalized marketing is personalized communication that addresses the customer by name in specific or ongoing marketing messages.</p>",
  "<p>An advanced CRM system allows you to automatically include the recipient’s name and contact details (retrieved from the customer database) in newsletters, advertisements, campaigns, and regular messages. When needed, you can also add a personalized opening sentence that speaks directly to the customer, upgrading their experience of the message.</p>",
  "<h2>Control Over Customer Interaction History</h2>",
  "<p>A good sales or service representative who wants to connect positively and personally with a customer must be fully aware of their history. This knowledge makes the customer feel they are not just another “number” among thousands, but that the organization is attentive to their past interactions, needs, and challenges.</p>",
  "<p>Working with a CRM system that provides a one-glance overview of the customer’s status is the perfect solution for this. Furthermore, a cloud-based and mobile-ready CRM system like <a href=\"http://www.skyz.co.il/skyzcrm-%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%9C-%D7%A7%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA/skyzsales/%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%9C-%D7%A7%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA/\">Skyz CRM</a> allows your representatives to access the customer’s history from anywhere, in real time. Another advantage is the display of live customer attributes, helping representatives manage conversations optimally.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>",
  "<p>A sales representative from a company selling IT solutions has a conversation with a long-time customer about upgrading their server. Using the CRM system and its ability to show the history of the last few years, the rep presents the customer’s history from the time they purchased the current server to recent recurring issues (with full details). This knowledge, combined with the upgrade offer, makes the customer feel valued and cared for, reinforcing their loyalty to the supplier.</p>",
  "<h2>Sharing Recommendations and Ideas to Help the Customer</h2>",
  "<p>The name of the game in the modern era is customer success. One of the best ways to achieve this is by sharing recommendations and ideas that can help them. Cloud-based, mobile-ready CRM systems with sharing features allow companies to enable customers to benefit from recommendations from colleagues, experts, and accumulated knowledge contributed by other customers in the system.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>",
  "<p>An organization selling company fun days uses its CRM system to create a knowledge center where customers can share recommendations for successful activities, special shows, or unique attractions worth checking before organizing a fun day. One such recommendation gave another organization the idea for an unconventional fun day event. This proves how much-added value customers can gain through the CRM system’s sharing components.</p>",
  "<h2>Personalized Support in Sales and Service Processes</h2>",
  "<p>One of the most essential and basic processes of personalized marketing is supporting the customer one-on-one on a personal level. Here too, the CRM system provides great added value in enabling effective, tailored guidance. The system, using the accumulated customer data-attributes, history, transactions, and challenges-helps manage interactions better, schedule reminders, and execute key activities such as motivational calls, price quotes, deal closures, and retention calls.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>",
  "<p>Imagine a sales representative from a logistics solutions company dealing with a major (high-revenue) but problematic long-term customer-difficult to reach, stressed at month-end, prefers short and direct calls-who the rep wants to pitch an innovative, high-cost solution to. The cloud-based, mobile-ready CRM system notes these unique customer traits, helping the rep manage the interaction wisely (avoiding mistakes that could kill the deal). Furthermore, the system’s flexibility in sending real-time reminders allows the rep to call the customer at just the right moment-when the timing is optimal for them.</p>",
  "<h2>In Summary:</h2>",
  "<p>A CRM system will boost your personalized marketing and customer experience by: smart use of automation, sending messages to segmented and targeted audiences, personalized one-on-one communications, control over customer interaction history, and personalized support for sales and service activities. This is the name of the game in the modern era!</p>"

  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>",
  "<strong>The difference between sales development representatives and salespeople is that the latter are responsible for closing deals from existing leads, while the former (sales development reps) provide them with leads after identifying, qualifying, and filtering them for readiness.</strong>",
  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>",
  "<strong>An advanced CRM system of the new era provides an excellent solution not only for sales teams in managing sales processes with end customers but also for sales development managers, thanks to a wide range of added values.</strong>",
  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>This article will explain and expand on Sales and Business Development (in the sales context), highlight their differences, how they complement each other functionally, and how they can effectively operate using next-generation CRM.</p>",
  "<p>Let’s start by clarifying the key terms:</p>",
  "<h2>Business Development</h2>",
  "<p>The term Business Development refers to processes, tasks, and actions for the overall growth of the company, with the main goal usually being to increase sales and revenue. To achieve this, business development managers use smart tactics such as identifying new audiences with innovative methods, qualifying leads to make them more effective, forming strategic partnerships with companies offering complementary products, creating competitive advantages over rivals, and more.</p>",
  "<h2>Sales Development</h2>",
  "<p>Sales Development essentially refers to business development in its sales aspect, aiming to implement processes that boost the organization’s sales. To achieve this, sales development managers use smart tactics to identify new relevant audiences for the company’s products, acquire quality leads, properly qualify them, and turn them into high-potential prospects, while building an initial relationship framework to prepare the customer for the deal-closing process.</p>",
  "<h2>Sales</h2>",
  "<p>Sales refers to selling products to customers and closing deals. Salespeople are responsible for handling transactions through the final stages until they are fully completed. To achieve this, sales reps present the value of the deal (benefits versus price), handle objections, and prepare sales agreements and contracts for signing.</p>",
  "<h2>What is the difference between Sales Development and Sales, and how do they complement each other?</h2>",
  "<p>The role of Sales Development is to collect, qualify, and identify the right, high-potential customers, build an initial customer/product foundation, and deliver well-prepared (“warm”) leads to the sales team.</p>",
  "<p>The role of Sales, on the other hand, is to take these leads and manage the critical process of closing deals with customers, overcoming challenges such as presenting the value proposition, handling objections, negotiating pricing, and resolving unforeseen issues until the sale is finalized.</p>",
  "<p>The distinction between the two functions does not diminish their complementary value. On the contrary—the ability of sales development teams to provide “warm” and effective leads helps sales teams close deals with significantly higher conversion rates and increase the organization’s sales cycle.</p>",
  "<p>In today’s competitive era, where acquiring customers is harder due to high competition and easy access to information, this complementary relationship between sales development and sales has tremendous added value. Each function specializes in its part of the sales process, and the outcome is measurable revenue growth.</p>",
  "<p>The separation between Business Development and Sales varies depending on the type and size of the organization. In small businesses, salespeople may manage the entire process, while in larger organizations, each function is usually handled by a dedicated department, enabling each to focus on its strengths and drive significant revenue growth.</p>",
  "<h2>Why is next-generation CRM so important for Business Development and Sales?</h2>",
  "<p>Understanding the importance of collaboration between Business Development and Sales only emphasizes the critical role of next-generation CRM. This system, managing customer relationships on a cloud- and mobile-based infrastructure with a social perspective, provides excellent support for both sales development and sales processes as follows:</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Sales Development</strong></h3>",
  "<p>A next-generation CRM system will allow sales development managers to:</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>Leverage detailed, real-time updated databases (fed by the sales department) on potential customers</li>",
  "<li>Analyze emerging trends using tools for detecting leads from different media and proactively extract smart reports</li>",
  "<li>Apply smart automated filters to identify more effective customers</li>",
  "<li>Monitor social media data to identify interested customers (thanks to CRM systems with social capabilities)</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3>",
  "<p>A next-generation CRM system will allow sales managers to:</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>View a comprehensive overview of sales processes at a glance</li>",
  "<li>Utilize automated customer tracking to efficiently manage sales (e.g., reminders for follow-ups)</li>",
  "<li>Manage sales processes from anywhere, in real time, enabling fast responses to customer inquiries</li>",
  "<li>Automatically route leads to the right salesperson, whether at home or in the field, through cloud and mobile technology</li>",
  "<li>Generate critical reports online (such as planning versus performance)</li>",

  "</p>",
  "<h2>Why is Efficient Workflow Essential for Customer Service?</h2>",

  "<p>These examples clearly illustrate the importance of proper and efficient workflow management.",
  "</p>",
  "<h2>CRM System – A Major Contribution to Workflow Management in Customer Service</h2>",
  "<p>A CRM system, especially one cloud-based and mobile-friendly, has a significant contribution to workflow management in customer service, expressed in the following added values:",
  "</p>",
  "<h2>Optimal Handling of High-Resolution Events</h2>",
  "<p>One of the most important aspects is optimal handling of service events with maximum accuracy in the customer support process. Service requests cover a wide spectrum, including product setup, post-purchase support, common bugs in the product or system, complex malfunctions, and more. Each of these cases requires building a unique workflow process involving different support agents, monitoring, and proper management.",
  "</p>",
  "<p>An advanced, cloud-based, mobile-friendly CRM system can greatly assist in managing events by helping build Workflow processes tailored to a wide range of situations. The process design will be efficient and can also greatly help in managing field service representatives by connecting to the CRM in real time via smartphone.",
  "</p>",
  "<h2>Automated Processes to Improve Efficiency</h2>",
  "<p>Workflow management is a highly necessary process for your customer service department, which can sometimes be long and complex. It is very advisable, whenever possible, to make it both accurate and efficient in order to be effective.",
  "</p>",
  "<p>An advanced CRM system plays a crucial role in optimizing this process by integrating built-in automated processes within Workflow management. For example, it could be through keywords routing a case to a specific agent for fast handling, or by the call source triggering the correct Workflow process to close the request to the customer's full satisfaction.",
  "</p>",
  "<h2>Accumulating Essential Knowledge About Service Processes</h2>",
  "<p>To better analyze service scenarios and customer support cases, which provide insights for building Workflow processes, it is crucial to gather as much information as possible about past and current cases.",
  "</p>",
  "<p>A cloud-based, mobile-friendly CRM system enables optimal knowledge accumulation about many service events. Event updates are possible from anywhere via an internet or smartphone connection—whether from the office, home, or field, 24/7—building organizational knowledge about various service demands, handling complex malfunctions, past failures, and successful processes, all of which greatly assist in Workflow process design.",
  "</p>",
  "<h2>Leveraging Insights Through Advanced Data Analysis</h2>",
  "<p>Smart insights into the dynamics and changing trends in customer service and support processes can greatly help in creating optimal workflow processes.",
  "</p>",
  "<p>The immense capability of CRM systems to analyze dynamic real-time data and present it through user-friendly, clear charts and graphs will help you identify trends and failures, making accurate adjustments to your Workflow processes.",
  "</p>",
  "<p>The dynamic market environment makes it highly likely that service scenarios you previously relied on for workflow management are no longer effective today. Leveraging insights will lead to necessary adjustments, which are very important to continuously improve customer satisfaction.",
  "</p>",
  "<h2>Flexibility in Workflow According to Need</h2>",
  "<p>Flexibility in changing workflow processes for your customer service is also very important, especially given the dynamic nature described above.",
  "</p>",
  "<p>An advanced CRM system can handle this both in designing the process and in its execution.",
  "</p>",
  "<p>For example, suppose a workflow process for a specific event is: a service call reaches the call center, is passed to a service manager for review, then to an in-office support representative, the problem is resolved remotely, and a closure report is sent to the service manager.",
  "</p>",
  "<p>After analyzing events, delays, and process failures, it was found that this process was not fast or efficient enough and needed to be changed as follows:",
  "</p>",
  "<p>The service call reaches the call center, is automatically routed via keyword automation to one of the field agents (who are more skilled in solving the problem), is resolved, and then reported as closed to the service manager.",
  "</p>",
  "<p>This change requires quickly building a new Workflow in the system as well as actual execution. Both of these capabilities are provided by an advanced cloud-based, mobile-friendly CRM system.",

      "</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<p>Below I will expand and explain.</p>",
      "<p>To make it easier to understand this issue, let’s clarify what is offered in the new era in each option of a CRM system versus a tailor-made software solution:</p>",
      "<h2>Customer Relationship Management System (CRM)</h2>",
      "<p>A CRM system in the new era is offered in two formats:</p>",
      "<ul>",
      "<li>Off-the-shelf software – This option is essentially a ready-made product, a modular software with existing components developed based on the vendor company’s vision (usually chosen partly or entirely by the client).</li>",
      "<li>Software platform – This is essentially a technological architecture that allows developing required applications on top of it.</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h2>Tailor-made Software Solution</h2>",
      "<p>A tailor-made software solution is one that is precisely customized to the client’s needs after thorough and detailed specifications. This solution enables the organization to meet any requirement according to specific or unique demands.</p>",
      "<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>",
      "<p><strong>What aspects should be considered when choosing a solution, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each option in every aspect?</strong></p>",
      "<h2>Technology</h2>",
      "<p>The technological aspect of the management information system you wish to establish in the organization is highly important in the new era, especially due to the strengthening of cloud and mobile trends. Let’s examine the options in this respect:</p>",
      "<h3><strong>CRM System</strong></h3>",
      "<p>When purchasing off-the-shelf CRM software or connecting to a CRM platform, you gain access to a variety of systems already developed (some with innovative cloud-based technology, such as <a href=\"http://www.skyz.co.il/\">Skyz</a>) to choose from. The major advantage is that you are choosing a system that has already faced technological challenges (through client support experience) and has made the necessary adjustments to maximize technological effectiveness.</p>",
      "<p>The second advantage is the ability to purchase and use systems in the SaaS (Software as a Service) model, allowing you to connect instantly without investments and start working. If you discover the system has technological issues, you can simply stop using it with no loss of time or investment.</p>",
      "<p>The only disadvantage, which I don’t consider critical, is the lack of full control over the technological development from scratch (since you are purchasing pre-developed systems).</p>",
      "<h3><strong>Tailor-made Software</strong></h3>",
      "<p>When deciding to develop a tailor-made solution from scratch, you will need to decide (in consultation with the developing company or experts) on the technology upon which the solution will be based.</p>",
      "<p>Advantage: You have full control and oversight over the technological development since it is made specifically for you.</p>",
      "<p>Disadvantage: You will need to deal with all the challenges and bugs that a software house with a large client base has already overcome, along with the vast knowledge they have accumulated from their extensive client experience.</p>",
      "<h2>Data Protection</h2>",
      "<p>There is no need to elaborate much on the importance of data protection regarding organizational customer management systems. Let’s analyze the options in this respect:</p>",
      "<h3><strong>CRM System</strong></h3>",
      "<p>Data protection in off-the-shelf or cloud-based CRM platforms requires providers to make significant investments in planning, time, and money. The protection is intended to secure sensitive data from many companies in the cloud, and in most cases, it is highly reliable and multi-layered. In this regard, cloud-based CRM systems have a significant advantage.</p>",
      "<p>The only disadvantage for you is the fact that you cannot know for certain how strong the security is since the data resides on the vendor’s servers. In most cases, however, you can rely on reputable vendors, as none would risk security failures in such a crucial and sensitive domain for their many clients.</p>",
      "<h3><strong>Tailor-made Software</strong></h3>",
      "<p>A tailor-made software solution requires you and the developing company to directly handle data protection. The disadvantage is the need to invest in training and significant money while taking the risk that data security may still not be perfect (including investment in computing if the system is hosted internally).</p>",
      "<p>On the positive side, it’s possible that your custom development may reach higher levels of security after all the investments, though it’s difficult to believe this will often be the case.</p>",
      "<h2>Money Saving</h2>",
      "<p>Now we arrive at one of the aspects that likely matters most to you – financial savings. Let’s analyze the options in this regard:</p>",
      "<h3><strong>CRM System</strong></h3>",
      "<p>A CRM system or CRM platform is infinitely more cost-effective than investing in tailor-made development, especially when it comes to cloud-based systems operating under the SaaS model. With such systems, you avoid development costs and simply subscribe monthly to an advanced system that makes you more efficient immediately.</p>",
      "<p>Furthermore, the dynamics, upgrades, and improvements required for CRM management fall on the software vendor’s shoulders, not yours. This translates to saving both time and money.</p>",
      "<p>In this aspect, I see no disadvantage in purchasing a system unless you constantly switch systems due to dissatisfaction, spending money endlessly on purchases and implementations – which seems highly unlikely.</p>",
      "<h3><strong>Tailor-made Software</strong></h3>",
      "<p>A tailor-made software solution requires heavy investments of time and money, especially during the initial development phase. Even after development, you’ll face bugs, improvements, and upgrades that will drain your budget. Unless you have a relative or friend who is an expert and can develop it for you, it’s hard to see how costs would be reduced.</p>",
      "<h2>Needs Matching</h2>",
      "<p>This aspect is of utmost importance since you would not purchase a system that doesn’t fully meet your organization’s needs. Let’s examine how the options align with this issue.</p>",
      "<h3><strong>CRM System</strong></h3>",
      "<p>When searching for a CRM system, you come with specific needs and work habits. Each CRM system is developed based on a comprehensive analysis of needs as perceived by its developers, often drawing from extensive experience with a wide range of clients.</p>",
      "<p>Undoubtedly, this can be seen as a disadvantage since it won’t always match your specific vision, habits, needs, and requirements. However, I believe it can also be seen positively: learning to work within the templates based on the average needs of many companies may also make your organization more efficient, though adopting such changes may initially be difficult.</p>",
      "<p>In any case, by connecting to a CRM platform, you essentially gain an architecture that facilitates the development of required applications tailored to your organization, enabling much better adaptation to specific needs.</p>",
      "<h3><strong>Tailor-made Software</strong></h3>",
      "<p>A tailor-made solution offers an excellent match to work requirements. There is no doubt that in this aspect, it has a significant advantage, as if the information system truly meets all needs, requirements, and work habits, the organization’s effectiveness will improve significantly.</p>",
      "<p>The only disadvantage is that poor specifications or planning can be very costly.</p>",
      "<h2>Flexibility</h2>",
      "<p>Flexibility is important to every company, especially growing ones that need a solution that evolves with them over time. Let’s see how the options address this aspect.</p>",
      "<h3><strong>CRM System</strong></h3>",
      "<p>CRM systems, especially those operating under the SaaS model, usually provide flexibility both at the module level and at the license level. For example, if you start with three users and only need a sales module, that’s what you get. A year later, if you grow, you can increase the number of users and add a service and support module. Conversely, if you decide to remove a component, you can easily do so.</p>",
      "<h3><strong>Tailor-made Software</strong></h3>",
      "<p>In contrast, a tailor-made solution is far less flexible since it is developed according to your specific requirements. These may focus only on the current situation or consider future needs, but who can guarantee that what you expect will actually happen? Such personal development can lead to unnecessary developments that cost both time and money.</p>",
      "<h2>Peace of Mind</h2>",
      "<p>Lastly, peace of mind is a highly important aspect. Let’s analyze the options here.</p>",
      "<h3><strong>CRM System</strong></h3>",
      "<p>A popular CRM software serving a wide range of clients, constantly receiving input and improving, is likely to provide a high-quality solution. Retaining clients will require quality customer service, from which you’ll benefit with high availability support ensuring organizational stability.</p>",
      "<p>On the other hand, you may be dissatisfied with the service level or rising support costs (in the SaaS model) and consider switching to another software, which may cause some inconvenience but not significant financial loss.</p>",
      "<h3><strong>Tailor-made Software</strong></h3>",
      "<p>A tailor-made solution ties you directly to the developing company, as they created the code specifically for you and provide the support. If the company is unstable or unresponsive when you urgently need assistance, you could face a real problem resulting in significant financial loss. The possibility of such a scenario creates insecurity and lack of peace of mind since your organization’s core system relies on dedicated software developers.</p>",
      "<h2>So, CRM System or Tailor-made Solution?</h2>",
      "<p>There is no doubt that choosing between a CRM system and a tailor-made solution requires analyzing each case individually according to the organization, its situation, its needs, and its work environment. However, based on the above analysis, it is quite clear that in the modern era, it is preferable to purchase a CRM system, especially a CRM platform. Such systems offer significant advantages in cost savings, technology, data security, flexibility, and peace of mind.</p>",
      "<p>Even when it comes to fully meeting needs, a CRM platform can provide a good solution that complements the other clear advantages, making it the most worthwhile choice.</p>",
      "<p>That said, if you have very unique needs requiring specific development, then a tailor-made solution may be preferable. In such cases, it is important to carefully check which vendor you plan to work with, as this partnership is akin to a long-term commitment.</p>"

    "</ul>",
    "<h2><strong>What is Direct Marketing Campaign Management?</strong></h2>",
    "<p>Direct marketing campaign management refers to managing the process of delivering messages directly to end customers via telephony, digital (emails), mobile, and social networks.</p>",
    "<p>The process includes: identifying and locating potential customers, segmenting target audiences relevant to the promoted product or service, selecting and refining marketing content and messages, and full multi-channel support of the campaign, including monitoring, analysis, and gaining insights for adjustments and future improvements.</p>",
    "<h2><strong>What does successful campaign management require from you?</strong></h2>",
    "<p>Direct marketing campaign management requires in-depth attention to the process characteristics as follows:</p>",
    "<h2>Precise Audience Targeting</h2>",
    "<p>In the initial stage of a direct marketing campaign, you must identify the right and precise target audiences in order to execute focused and effective exposure. The relevant audiences for advertising can be selected by purchasing external mailing lists that match your marketing needs, or by using existing customer lists in the organization’s databases (with the option to segment them according to required characteristics).</p>",
    "<p>* It is important to note that sending newsletters, messages, or any marketing phone communication must comply with local privacy and anti-spam laws.</p>",
    "<h2>Smart Lead Management</h2>",
    "<p>Successful execution of a direct marketing campaign requires smart and efficient lead management. To maximize the number of actual deals, you must accurately track incoming inquiries and gain insights regarding their sources, in terms of media type, advertising content/information presented, and call-to-action mechanisms.</p>",
    "<p>Smart lead management will provide you with an overview of the quantity and quality of incoming leads, improve their conversion into sales opportunities, perform monitoring, identify failures, and give you a full picture of the process from receiving inquiries to converting them into actual deals.</p>",
    "<h2>Multi-Channel Actions</h2>",
    "<p>The current era allows us to manage direct marketing campaigns via the internet, mobile, and social networks, in addition to telephony and print (considered traditional). Since the target audience is diverse in terms of preferred communication channels (print, telephony, emails, SMS, social networks), it is crucial to manage combined actions across multiple channels, in order to properly address each potential customer within the campaign according to their preferred channel.</p>",
    "<p>Of course, each channel you activate in the campaign requires the correct adjustment of the advertising concept to maximize effectiveness (see explanation in the next section).</p>",
    "<h2>Functional Marketing Content Tailored to Target Audiences</h2>",
    "<p>Marketing content plays a super important role in the success of direct marketing campaigns. You must present the content correctly by emphasizing added value, ensuring sharp messages adapted to target audiences, and motivating action to increase conversion rates into actual deals.</p>",
    "<p>The variety of marketing platforms requires you to create tailored messages, i.e., different content (in message, scope, use of images and videos, and type of call-to-action) for direct marketing actions sent via print, email, mobile, and social networks. For example: an SMS campaign, by its very nature on a smartphone, requires short, quick, and concise content compared to the same campaign sent to the target audience by email.</p>",
    "<h2>Efficiency of the Management Team</h2>",
    "<p>Behind every campaign stand the people managing it. Human capital in these processes is critical, as they are the minds responsible for audience targeting, message building, campaign analysis, and gaining insights.</p>",
    "<p>Firstly, it is important that your management team understands the world of marketing in the new era with all its developments. Secondly, and no less important, they must know how to efficiently operate campaign management tools, especially regarding the optimal use of the organization’s CRM system.</p>",
    "<h2>Advanced Analysis and Measurement Capabilities</h2>",
    "<p>Direct marketing campaigns are dynamic processes influenced by many endogenous and exogenous factors. You must emphasize advanced analysis and measurement capabilities that will help you obtain an overview of successes, failures, and trends related to each stage of the direct marketing campaign process, as well as the final results.</p>",
    "<h2>Implementing Improvements and Adjustments Quickly</h2>",
    "<p>Analysis and measurement are very important, but ultimately, adjustments and improvements must be implemented to leverage future results as soon as possible. In today’s dynamic era, quick response to changing trends is a critical factor for success. Therefore, you must gain the right insights in various aspects of campaign management and apply them already in your upcoming campaigns.</p>",
    "<h2><strong>Why is CRM the key tool for campaign management?</strong></h2>",
    "<h2>Automation</h2>",
    "<p>An advanced CRM system (<a href=\"http://www.skyz.co.il/\">such as Skyz</a>) provides you with automated processes for managing and sending the campaign itself, as well as managing the leads received until actual deals are closed.</p>",
    "<p>The ability to launch a direct marketing campaign directly from the system greatly streamlines your work, saving you valuable time and money. Moreover, the ability to focus and precisely target audiences (segmented using the system’s filters) improves conversion rates and leads to better campaign results.</p>",
    "<p>The advantage of automation is also evident in managing the leads themselves throughout the sales process. A customer relationship management system allows incoming leads to automatically open customer records in the system, obtain an accurate status overview at any time, from anywhere, and manage more effective processes from campaign launch to final closings.</p>",
    "<h2>Leads Follow Up</h2>",
    "<p>In terms of managing lead follow-up processes, there is no doubt that the CRM system plays a vital role. Using CRM, you can track inquiries coming directly from the campaign, perform filtering according to criteria you define, carry out monitoring, and maximize the conversion of effective leads into actual deals.</p>",
    "<h2>Customer Characteristics</h2>",
    "<p>CRM software provides you with important capabilities regarding the selection of precise target audiences based on segmentation by characteristics.</p>",
    "<p>The system allows you to manage customer profiles wisely, add attributes, update and access their history from anywhere in real time. This vital information will help you segment target audiences at a high resolution and execute highly focused campaigns from within your databases (of course while complying with privacy and anti-spam laws).</p>",
    "<h2>Knowledge Base</h2>",
    "<p>One of the biggest advantages of CRM is the vast marketing knowledge accumulated in the system. Updating lead and customer information over time generates valuable insights into trends, successes, and failures relating to a wide range of factors. This accumulated data sharpens your ability to identify relevant target audiences, the quality of advertising messages, proper campaign management, and more.</p>",
    "<h2>Smart Reports</h2>",
    "<p>With a modern CRM system, you can extract smart reports to analyze the process at its various stages, from campaign launch and lead acquisition to final deal closures. You can measure conversion rates at different stages, including those handled by the sales team. In addition, you can…</p>"

    "<li>",
    "<strong>Effective service goals must be measurable (preferably through CRM), attainable, and clear to everyone.</strong>",
    "</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>",
    "<strong>Defining service goals is an essential process that includes full involvement of the organization’s staff, understanding the current situation, creating smart tactics, dealing with challenges, monitoring on both individual and group levels, and making necessary adjustments.</strong>",
    "</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>",
    "<strong>An advanced CRM system plays a central role in the process of defining service goals in terms of collaboration, tracking, control, measurement, and insights.</strong>",
    "</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p>This article is dedicated to the important topic of defining service goals tailored to the company’s needs, while highlighting the significant support of an advanced CRM system. Managing this process properly will help service staff achieve their goals with maximum effectiveness and will greatly contribute to the organization’s productivity.</p>",
    "<h2><strong>What Are the Three Main Motifs of Service Goals?</strong></h2>",
    "<h2>Measurable Targets</h2>",
    "<p>The first key motif of service goals is the ability to measure them throughout the process. Measurement should be carried out through milestones that allow you to compare the situation before and after implementing the strategy of defining the process, in order to draw conclusions about the factors, reasons, and means that contribute to achieving the goals.</p>",
    "<h2>Attainable Targets</h2>",
    "<p>The second motif refers to the attainability of the goals. It is very important that service goals are achievable, but equally important that they contribute to real improvement in service and growth. You must ensure that your service team can reach the targets you set for them, while still being challenged.</p>",
    "<h2>Clear and Focused Targets</h2>",
    "<p>Service goals should be clear, well-defined, and focused for your service team. Proper phrasing and clear understanding of the objectives will satisfy them and sharpen the team’s performance. Ultimately, this will bring much greater achievements in service overall and for them personally.</p>",
    "<h2><strong>How to Properly Carry Out the Process of Defining Service Goals?</strong></h2>",
    "<h2>Sharing Service Goals with All Staff</h2>",
    "<p>The main objectives of customer service are usually based on customer satisfaction and take into account fewer marketing and business goals. To ensure that service goals align with the organization’s other objectives (marketing, operational, business), it is important to manage the goal-setting process with full collaboration across departments, in order to connect to the overall organizational strategy.</p>",
    "<p>This will also make measuring success in achieving service goals more accurate and reliable. For example, if you set a target for your team to increase retention of new customers (added in the past three years) by 10%, and at the same time, your marketing department launched an attractive upsell campaign for all customers, it is likely that part of the retention growth came from the campaign. In other words, analyzing the achievement of service goals is clearer and more accurate when considering all organizational factors.</p>",
    "<p>Another important point is that sharing goals with other employees in the organization significantly boosts your service team’s motivation. They see their achievements as a major contribution to the success of the entire organization across all departments.</p>",
    "<h2>Understanding the Current Situation, Market Environment, and New Trends</h2>",
    "<p>Defining service goals requires you to understand the organization’s current state, the market environment in terms of customers and competitors, and the local and global trends related to customer service.</p>",
    "<p>First, you need to understand the current picture: What is your level of customer satisfaction today? Which current issues do you want to prevent in the future? What should be maintained and what should be improved?</p>",
    "<p>Second, feel the market environment. What is happening with your competitors’ customer service? How sensitive are customers to service levels, and what do they expect?</p>",
    "<p>Third, what are the trends in customer service in your industry today? The dynamic nature of the field requires you to constantly stay up to date with new trends, as they shape consumer expectations and create new definitions of service quality.</p>",
    "<h2>Creating Smart and Clear Tactics to Achieve the Goals</h2>",
    "<p>It is essential that the definition of service goals is accompanied by clear and consistent tactics that will help your service team achieve them. Returning to the example of increasing customer retention by 10%, you can support this target with tactics such as: quarterly proactive calls to ensure customer satisfaction and help them gain more value from the product, connecting customers to a knowledge center with FAQs within a cloud-based CRM system, sending weekly newsletters, and more.</p>",
    "<p>When the final objective is broken down into smaller tactics, it will look much less intimidating and more achievable.</p>",
    "<h2>Stepping Out of the Comfort Zone and Facing Challenges</h2>",
    "<p>There is no doubt that service goals should be attainable. At the same time, it is necessary to continuously challenge the service team to keep them alert and engaged, avoiding boredom that could lead to laziness and incompetence in the long run. Facing challenges that are not overly complex will push them out of their comfort zone, create drive, and improve their productivity.</p>",
    "<p>Challenges can be introduced by raising the target threshold (still at a realistic level). For example, setting a retention increase of 12% instead of the original 10%, or presenting smaller monthly and quarterly challenges.</p>",
    "<h2>Individual and Group Monitoring and Control</h2>",
    "<p>Assigning different employees to various service teams, as well as integrating new staff members, requires both individual and group monitoring and control. Monitoring will help surface successes, complex processes, problems, and failures in customer service.</p>",
    "<p>When a large team is working toward a general goal, it is difficult to track individual service activities. Through monitoring and control (ideally using an advanced CRM system), you can analyze service processes at both the team and individual levels in high resolution, providing insights for proper definition of service goals.</p>",
    "<h2>Making Necessary Adjustments for Maximum Effectiveness</h2>",
    "<p>Although service goals are set as part of the strategic plan, they still require adjustments based on staff quality, technological efficiency, market dynamics, and changes in existing tactics. For example, customer retention might improve thanks to better technology or a new customer management system, allowing you to raise the retention target for the coming year. On the other hand, staff changes may require lowering the target to avoid frustrating a new team.</p>",
    "<p>It is important to consistently collect feedback from the team and/or keep ongoing documentation of successes, failures, and issues in the organization’s CRM system. This will allow you to analyze high-resolution data to extract insights and make necessary adjustments.</p>",
    "<h2><strong>What Is the Role of CRM in the Goal-Setting Process?</strong></h2>",
    "<p>An advanced cloud-based, mobile-friendly CRM system plays a critical role in the process of defining service goals, as outlined above:</p>",
    "<h2>Sharing</h2>",
    "<p>A cloud and mobile-based CRM system significantly facilitates sharing the process of defining service goals with all employees. As noted, each department has essential information that contributes to a more accurate definition of goals, aligned with the organization’s overall strategy. The ability for every employee to update in real-time, from anywhere, is crucial to the process’s success.</p>",
    "<h2>Follow-Up</h2>",
    "<p>An advanced customer relationship management system dramatically improves personal and group monitoring and control capabilities. The system’s high automation enables you to quickly and easily detect successes, failures, and issues within the process, especially when dealing with large, complex teams.</p>",
    "<h2>Measurement</h2>",
    "<p>One of the cornerstones of defining service goals is the ability to measure. A cloud and mobile-based advanced CRM system allows you to measure goal achievements with high efficiency and precision, at both individual and group levels, to gain an accurate picture. This measurement is critical for presenting key data needed for process building.</p>",
    "<h2>Insights</h2>",
    "<p>A cloud-based CRM system will help you extract smart reports on service processes and gain insights across different dimensions online from anywhere. These highly accurate insights will enable you to make the necessary adjustments for maximum effectiveness in the process of defining service goals.</p>"

  "<strong>Every sales and/or customer service professional knows that good business is not just about making a one-time successful deal. In today’s era, the name of the game is extending the customer lifecycle.</strong>",
  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>",
  "<strong>The components of a customer lifecycle are built from a multi-stage process that develops from initial search and discovery, market education, matching needs, product purchase, post-purchase engagement, and turning the customer into a brand asset.</strong>",
  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>",
  "<strong>The contribution of a CRM system to the customer lifecycle in the modern era is tremendous and is reflected in almost every stage of the process.</strong>",
  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<h2>What is the Customer Lifecycle?</h2>",
  "<h3><strong>Search &amp; Discovery</strong></h3>",
  "<p>This is the initial stage of the lifecycle where the customer compares brands and competitors, gathers information, and reads reviews. At the end of this process, the customer leans toward a specific brand while facing several questions and concerns that need to be addressed.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Market Education</strong></h3>",
  "<p>At this stage, the brand responds to customer questions and provides answers that strengthen confidence in the product choice. This is also the time for market education, especially for new products with limited exposure in relevant target audiences.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Matching Needs</strong></h3>",
  "<p>This component connects to the previous stage and involves aligning with the customer’s needs. At this point, the organization offers the most suitable product from its portfolio. In the case of a solution sale, this means tailoring a specification according to the customer’s requirements to deliver the most accurate solution.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Product Purchasing</strong></h3>",
  "<p>The next step is the purchase. After receiving all the information and verifying fit to their needs, the customer makes a decision and completes the purchase. At the same time, the company monitors to ensure everything went smoothly and the sale was successful.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Post-Purchase Engagement</strong></h3>",
  "<p>After the purchase, the organization checks in (via phone, meeting, or digital channels) to ask the customer about their experience with the product, solution, or service. This activity drives customer retention while also providing crucial insights for improvements and upgrades.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Becoming a Brand Asset</strong></h3>",
  "<p>This is the final and most important stage. The customer feels like an asset of the brand, continues to purchase again, and recommends the product to others through word-of-mouth and positive online reviews.</p>",
  "<h2>How to Implement Customer Lifecycle Extension in Your Company?</h2>",
  "<h3><strong>Search &amp; Discovery</strong></h3>",
  "<p>The key here is smart use of marketing content exposed in the right media, at the right time, and in the right format for the potential customer in their early search stage. This requires gathering market insights, analyzing content marketing activities, and generating actionable insights. Success here is critical to ‘catch’ the customer, otherwise the chance of losing them is high.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Market Education</strong></h3>",
  "<p>In this second stage, your sales reps should demonstrate the added value of the product, service, or solution in a precise and tailored way that fits the customer profile. These processes may be executed via calls, emails, WhatsApp, or face-to-face meetings. Another helpful tool is creating a customer knowledge center with articles, media clips, tips, case studies, and smart FAQ mechanisms.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Matching Needs</strong></h3>",
  "<p>This stage focuses on understanding the customer’s individual characteristics and needs. Your sales reps should present the most suitable product (or build a tailored solution after detailed profiling). This is essential to give the customer confidence that the product will serve them effectively.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Product Purchasing</strong></h3>",
  "<p>The purchasing stage requires you to create optimal conditions for a smooth transaction. Tools that can help include online ordering systems and full automation of the purchase process, ensuring speed, efficiency, transparency, and clear deal terms.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Post-Purchase Engagement</strong></h3>",
  "<p>This is a critical stage where you must abandon the mindset of a ‘one-time sale’ and focus on long-term retention. Creative retention tactics include loyalty programs, newsletters, customer conferences, regular meetings, upselling and cross-selling, and any initiative that adds long-term value. Insights collected from this engagement help improve and upgrade product quality.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Becoming a Brand Asset</strong></h3>",
  "<p>At this final stage, it is highly recommended to encourage satisfied customers to share positive reviews and experiences on social media. Conducting satisfaction surveys from time to time can also increase their motivation to refer new customers.</p>",
  "<h2>What is the Contribution of CRM to the Customer Lifecycle?</h2>",
  "<p>Implementing customer lifecycle extension relies heavily on the use of advanced CRM capabilities in almost every stage:</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Search &amp; Discovery</strong></h3>",
  "<p>Advanced CRM marketing tools, such as those in <a href=\"http://www.skyz.co.il/skyzcrm-%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%9C-%D7%A7%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA/skyzmarketing/\">SkyzMarketing</a>, will help with marketing content exposure to identify potential customers. They enable analysis of inbound marketing efforts and ad campaign optimization for better exposure in the right media at the right timing.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Market Education</strong></h3>",
  "<p>Modern CRM systems based on cloud and mobile technology allow you not only to manage customer relations (tracking, reminders, meetings) but also to establish a knowledge center within the system itself (which can integrate with the company’s website). This center can feature success stories, useful tips, and relevant articles accessible in real time to your entire team.</p>",
  "<p>Another added value of CRM for market education is the ability to identify customer ‘pain points’ through data analysis, gain insights, and translate them into more impactful marketing content.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Matching Needs</strong></h3>",
  "<p>A CRM system that collects rich customer history will provide vital data and present a detailed, high-resolution view of customer needs. Moreover, audience segmentation based on attributes will significantly improve sales reps’ ability to match customers with the right products or solutions.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Product Purchasing</strong></h3>",
  "<p>Advanced CRM platforms feature automation that optimizes the purchase process for both company and customers. In cloud-based and mobile systems, deal details and conditions can be displayed to new buyers anytime, anywhere, in real time.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Post-Purchase Engagement</strong></h3>",
  "<p>A CRM system will support you at this critical stage through automated retention activities. Advanced systems enable creative campaigns for brand reinforcement, flexible newsletter distribution, effective upselling and cross-selling processes, customer club management, automatic event invitations, and personal retention reminders.</p>",
  "<h3><strong>Becoming a Brand Asset</strong></h3>",
  "<p>At this stage, advanced CRM systems can help manage automated satisfaction surveys and questionnaires. Efficiency is further reflected in the ability to analyze the data and extract insights anytime, anywhere, in real time.</p>"

This effective process projects professionalism and consistently impacts the customer experience.",

  "<h2>Comprehensive Customer Information Anywhere",
  "</h2>",

  "</p>",
  "<p>For example, if a service call is received regarding a complex product marketed by the company, and the specialized service representative is outside the office on the way to clients, field CRM solves the problem.

  "<strong>It is advisable to emphasize proactive customer service in order to reduce unnecessary questions and interactions, improve the customer experience, and prevent issues and failures by gaining insights in advance.</strong>",

  "<ul>",
  "<li>",
  "<strong>Proper implementation of proactive customer service (especially in Israel) requires sending surveys and receiving feedback, creating knowledge bases, contacting customers at the right times, producing newsletters, and updating about potential products. For this, it is recommended to use an advanced </strong><strong>CRM</strong><strong> system!</strong>",
  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<h2>",
  "<strong>What is Proactive Customer Service?</strong>",
  "</h2>",
  "<p>Proactive customer service refers to a situation where service representatives reach out on their own initiative to customers in order to notify them of an error or malfunction during the rollout of a new product, or to improve the customer experience and increase satisfaction with the support in particular and the organization in general.</p>",
  "<p>What is the difference between reactive and proactive customer service?</p>",
  "<p>To understand the difference between reactive and proactive customer service, I will illustrate it with an analogy from the world of medicine.</p>",
  "<p>“Reactive customer service” behaves like medication that people take after the illness has already affected the body in order to cure it. On the other hand, “Proactive customer service” behaves like a vaccine that is administered to proactively protect the body from a future illness.</p>",
  "<p>If we return to the world of service and support, reactive customer service provides a response to the customer after a problem has already occurred, whereas proactive customer service offers solutions to issues that have not yet happened, prevents them in advance, and increases the customer’s positive perception.</p>",
  "<h2>",
  "<strong>Why is it important to emphasize proactive customer service?</strong>",
  "</h2>",
  "<p>Investing in proactive customer service has enormous added value for organizations. First, good work in this area will dramatically reduce unnecessary questions and future interactions, saving the support team a great deal of time. Second, customer experience and loyalty improve immensely when customers feel that the company itself takes the initiative to reach out and check in with them. Lastly, and most critically, proactive customer service prevents many issues and failures by gaining insights in advance, adapting processes for efficiency, and saving significant amounts of money.</p>",
  "<h2>",
  "<strong>How should you properly implement proactive customer service?</strong>",
  "</h2>",
  "<h2>Send Surveys</h2>",
  "<p>One of the most important actions you should implement is conducting questionnaires and surveys. These questionnaires should extract real information about customer satisfaction with the service and highlight problems and failures for future improvement.</p>",
  "<p>This type of feedback can ask customers, for example: What would you like us to do more for you? What bothers you most about the support we provide? What would you like us to do in order to improve your customer experience?</p>",
  "<p>These surveys will provide you with valuable insights, which when implemented, can often prevent churn and even strengthen long-term loyalty.</p>",
  "<h2>Build a Knowledge Base</h2>",
  "<p>Creating a central knowledge base for customers is a highly important proactive step in the new era. This base can generate added value by providing solutions and troubleshooting, answering questions, do’s and don’ts, new issues, user guides, and more.</p>",
  "<p>In practice, you can implement this step through innovative CRM systems that promote the knowledge base as part of development processes. Systems best suited for this are those based on cloud and mobile technology. With these advanced systems, your customers can access vital knowledge from anywhere, in real time, on operational issues or matters related to purchased products, significantly reducing the workload on your customer service team (a win-win for both sides).</p>",
  "<h2>Contact Customers at the Right Time</h2>",
  "<p>Customers always feel better when occasionally asked how they are doing, and not only when companies are trying to sell them something (especially here in Israel). This sense of care is crucial for improving long-term loyalty and increasing revenues from customers.</p>",
  "<p>To improve customer sentiment, it is advisable to consistently reach out proactively at the right times using automatic reminders from an advanced CRM system.</p>",
  "<p>For example, if you have a frustrated customer who frequently complains about issues with your product or service, you can proactively reach out on their birthday (with a CRM reminder) and offer a special benefit. This move can not only calm them down but even dramatically change their satisfaction and loyalty over time.</p>",
  "<h2>Send Newsletters</h2>",
  "<p>Regular, ongoing communication can be a wonderful tool for improving customer satisfaction. One of the most effective tools to help with this is producing and sending newsletters from time to time. The newsletter can include news, interesting articles in the field, and/or special promotions.</p>",
  "<p>In this case as well, a CRM system can help by analyzing data to provide insights into reader interest and using automation to send newsletters directly from the system, leveraging email marketing capabilities to targeted audiences based on their interests.</p>",
  "<h2>Update Customers with Potential Products</h2>",
  "<p>Another positive proactive step is updating existing customers on upgrades to current products or offering complementary products (upselling and cross-selling). This action will strengthen the organization’s relationship with customers on the one hand, and on the other, can significantly increase revenues from each customer and overall.</p>",
  "<p>For example, if your company deals with selling electric bikes, you can proactively offer complementary products such as a water bottle holder, newly arrived helmets, special gloves, and so on. Of course, product updates can also be automated using built-in SMS or email marketing tools in advanced CRM systems.</p>"

  "<ul>",
  "<li>Automation of processes with the customer, starting from the sales stage, through negotiations and closing a deal, and ending with customer support and loyalty programs</li>",

  "<li>Central reports and surveys on service quality with the option to analyze support levels by service representatives and customers.</li>",

  "<h2>",
  "<strong>CRM Software vs. CSS Software: Which is Right for You?</strong>",
  "</h2>",
  "<p>Both customer service software (CSS) and customer relationship management software (CRM) provide efficient solutions for a company’s customer service needs, but each is better suited for different cases. So, which one is right for you?</p>",
  "<p>To make the right decision, you need to analyze your organization’s activities according to the following aspects:</p>",
  "<h2>Type of Company’s Activity</h2>",
  "<p>The first and most basic aspect you need to check is the nature of the company’s activity. Does the organization’s activity rely solely on providing services, or is the main focus on selling products and providing support after purchase?</p>",
  "<p>If your organization’s activity is mostly service-based, it is definitely worth considering an advanced CSS system that will provide a fully operational solution dedicated to service.</p>",
  "<p>On the other hand, if your company’s activity is based on sales and post-purchase support, without a doubt you should choose CRM software that can manage the entire sales and customer service process in one system with a shared database that will streamline processes and provide smart insights from the comprehensive management of the process.</p>",
  "<h2>Required Knowledge Base</h2>",
  "<p>Another important aspect is how your organization views its knowledge base. Is it essential that the customer service knowledge base be shared with other departments such as marketing and sales, or should it stand independently?</p>",
  "<p>If you decide that the customer service knowledge base should remain within the department’s “boundaries,” then you may want to consider acquiring a customer service management system.</p>",
  "<p>However, if you decide that it is essential for the organization’s knowledge base to be shared across all departments (which is usually desirable), then CRM software will be much more suitable due to its ability to handle sales, marketing, and customer service data in one advanced, smart hub.</p>",
  "<h2>Company’s Departments Collaboration</h2>",
  "<p>Another point to consider in deciding which system to purchase is the level of collaboration between the company’s departments regarding sales, marketing, and service. The question you need to ask is whether synergy between the different departments is important to you, or if you prefer that the service department function as an autonomous unit without connection to others.</p>",
  "<p>If your management policy is full collaboration between departments, it is recommended to purchase CRM software that provides excellent solutions for automated processes connecting departments, shared customer information, and reports combining sales, marketing, and service activities.</p>",
  "<p>On the other hand, if you have decided that your organization’s customer service will operate as an autonomous unit with unique needs unrelated to the rest of the organization, then customer service software may be the right solution.</p>",
  "<h2>Customer Service Department Needs</h2>",
  "<p>Another important aspect to consider is, of course, the specific needs of the customer service department. This requires you to thoroughly analyze the department’s management, operational, and communication needs with customers.</p>",
  "<p>If your organization’s needs (due to the type of activity and/or management decisions) require a unique service system (for example, if multi-channel communication including advanced chat is important to you), then a CSS system will be preferable. On the other hand, if the needs are more aligned with joint work with marketing and sales, then purchasing a CRM system is the right step.</p>",
  "<h2>Customer Overview</h2>",
  "<p>Customer overview is of great importance in the new era, especially when it comes to customer service. To choose the right system, you should ask yourself whether you need a focused view only of support-related processes, or a comprehensive view of the customer’s attributes, history, and interactions from the very first sale onwards.</p>",
  "<p>Of course, you can decide to limit the customer overview only to service, in which case CSS will meet your needs in this aspect. However, in today’s environment, in most cases if not all, the desired customer view for service and support agents (including via mobile in the field) is a 360-degree view of the customer (attributes, history, documents, quotes, and more). Therefore, it is recommended to choose advanced CRM software.</p>",
  "<h2>Ongoing Communication</h2>",
  "<p>The method of communication with customers is a central factor in support and customer service. To choose suitable software, you must ask yourself how your communication with customers is carried out.</p>",
  "<p>If the communication is multi-channel and includes a smart chat system, CSS will be preferable to CRM. However, given the growing trend of social CRM (leveraging communication via social networks and more), advanced CRM systems can also provide an adequate solution.</p>",
  "<h2>",
  "<strong>Conclusion</strong>",
  "</h2>",
  "<p>To make the right decision on whether to choose CSS or CRM for your organization’s customer service department, you should examine the following aspects: type of company activity, required knowledge base, interdepartmental collaboration, customer service department needs, customer overview, and ongoing communication with customers.</p>",
  "<p>After analyzing these aspects (as presented above), you will gain insights that will help your organization choose the right system.</p>"

Inbound calls are a fundamental aspect of customer service centers, which in the modern era have gained even greater importance, with many centers expanding to provide 24/7 responses supported by remote centers.</p>",
  "<h2>Outbound Calls</h2>",
  "<p>The term Outbound Calls refers to phone calls made by the support team outward to customers. While inbound calls are initiated by the customer, outbound calls are initiated by company support representatives. The purpose of outbound calls is to improve availability for customers (by proactive outreach from the support department) and prevent frustration caused by long wait times. In addition, outbound calls from service representatives support the customer’s positive feeling, sending the message that “the company cares.”</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Why is managing Inbound Calls so critical for customer service in the modern era?</strong></h2>",
  "<p>The internet and mobile revolutions of the modern era dramatically influence the customer experience, especially regarding service and support. The ability to make calls from anywhere has increased dramatically due to smartphones being accessible to everyone, and has also expanded to include multiple communication options beyond regular calls such as SMS, WhatsApp, and even social networks.</p>",
  "<p>Organizations must be prepared for this, especially since today’s fast-paced and crowded world has raised expectations for maximum availability from support and service systems.</p>",
  "<p>Therefore, inbound calls must be handled by organizations with the highest level of professionalism, taking into account the new behavioral patterns derived from modern trends.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>How can you better manage Inbound Calls?</strong></h2>",
  "<h2>Keeping an open channel for high-value customers</h2>",
  "<p>These may include strategic clients, long-standing customers who were among the first to buy from the company, new customers with high sensitivity to support, or frustrated clients. For these mapped-out customers, the organization must provide fast service responses while keeping a real-time open channel.</p>",
  "<p>Ideally, everyone should receive First Class service. However, since life isn’t perfect, it is highly advisable to avoid damaging the service experience of these customers, as their dissatisfaction could result in losing valuable clients altogether.</p>",
  "<h2>Delivering on the promise of true availability</h2>",
  "<p>Another important tip is fulfilling service representatives’ promise of quick availability. Your promise raises high expectations among customers, so it is crucial to meet it. Essentially, what should guide you is ensuring the customer feels you are doing your utmost to provide the best support.</p>",
  "<p>What should NOT be done is making unrealistic promises and failing to deliver. For example, it is better to specify in the service-level agreement slower response times that you can reliably meet, than to promise fast responses but actually deliver clumsy, slow service that frustrates customers.</p>",
  "<p>A good way to handle this is to create several tiers of support, priced differently according to response time. Such an approach will reduce deviations from promised response times that your support team presented to customers.</p>",
  "<h2>Professional call tracking and analysis</h2>",
  "<p>Call analysis is critical for an organization’s success in streamlining its customer service department. By analyzing interactions with customers, you can profile them by various parameters that will help improve support efforts.</p>",
  "<p>In today’s world of advanced cloud-based and mobile-enabled CRM systems, data can be updated by your service and support staff in great detail, enabling highly accurate analysis of trends, successes, failures, and generating smart insights for more effective inbound call management.</p>",
  "<h2>Working with CRM</h2>",
  "<p><strong>This is a super important tip!</strong> Efficient support staff operations require close work with an advanced CRM system. When a call is received, the representative is presented with the full customer history (including attributes), enabling efficient, focused, and professional handling. Since all information is available to your representative in real time, they can fully understand the customer’s situation and optimally respond to the issue.</p>",
  "<p>Without an updated view provided by customer management software, it is very difficult to expect customers today to tolerate cumbersome responses or lack of knowledge about their processes with your organization…</p>",
  "<h2>Personalized customer response</h2>",
  "<p>Another important factor derived from modern trends is the format of customer response. The variety of communication options—calls, SMS, chat, WhatsApp, or social networks—requires you to pay attention and aim to provide optimal support according to the customer’s preferred communication method. For example, if a customer prefers chat support, your support staff must adapt to that channel.</p>",
  "<p>In this context, we can see the development of <a href=\"https://skyzblog.co.il/crm-%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%99-scrm-%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A2-%D7%96%D7%94-%D7%9B%D7%9C-%D7%9B%D7%9A-%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91-%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%97%D7%95/\">Social CRM</a>, one of whose drivers is the ability to provide responses to customers through their preferred communication channels.</p>"

    "<strong>Efficient document management has always been, and remains, one of the most crucial keys to the business operations of companies and organizations.</strong>",
    "</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>",
    "<strong>Undoubtedly, an independent document management software (or as part of a CRM) has become the leading tool for managing organizational documents. A company that does not manage documents with such a tool loses a significant competitive advantage.</strong>",
    "</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li>",
    "<strong>Document management systems present new trends in today’s era, driven mainly by the transition to cloud technology, the mobile revolution, and above all, the real need of every company, large or small, to adopt an efficient solution for managing organizational documents.</strong>",
    "</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p>Document management has always been, and remains, one of the central and critical keys to the business operations of businesses, companies, and organizations. The massive document traffic in the modern era leaves no choice but to find effective solutions to prevent unnecessary complexity and ensure efficient management.</p>",
    "<p>Document management software has become the leading tool for managing documents, files, and organizational information—either as a standalone solution or integrated as a core module within CRM software.</p>",
    "<p>In this article, I will highlight the new trends related to document management systems, with reference to working in cloud technology, the Social Mobile revolution, and additional processes that are gaining momentum in the new era.</p>",
    "<h2>Cloud is the New Game Changer</h2>",
    "<p>The trend of using cloud technology, which has gained strong momentum in recent years, is changing the rules of the game in management software in general, and in document management in particular. The cloud ensures full availability of required documents anytime, anywhere, in real time. No need to access a specific computer or a closed network— all you need is an internet connection. The added value: <strong>effective operations and saving valuable time!!</strong></p>",
    "<p>For example: if one of your salespeople is at a client’s office about to close a deal and needs to present a previously signed agreement, there is no need to return to the office, search the computer, and retrieve the agreement. With a cloud-based document management system, the document can be presented instantly via internet access to the system.</p>",
    "<h2>Automatic Indexing of Files</h2>",
    "<p>Another trend in document management systems is the automatic filing and indexing of all types of files online. This includes scanned paper documents, emails, and all relevant electronic files, indexed automatically and intelligently—significantly simplifying storage and document management.</p>",
    "<p>In the past, data entry teams had to manually create index fields for archived information. Today, new indexing technology can intelligently identify index values based on prior user actions, increasing efficiency and improving productivity.</p>",
    "<h2>User Experience in Mobile</h2>",
    "<p>We all experience the mobile revolution, and document management systems cannot ignore it. More than that, mobile-based document management is extremely essential because sales agents, support staff, technicians, and professionals are constantly on the move and require quick and efficient access to critical files and documents.</p>",
    "<p>But access alone isn’t enough. The system must also be user-friendly on smartphones, tablets, iPhones, and iPads. This explains the rising trend of adopting document management systems that put great emphasis on excellent mobile user experience.</p>",
    "<p>This strong user experience allows you to quickly access and retrieve documents, significantly easing your fieldwork activities.</p>",
    "<h2>Social Document Management</h2>",
    "<p>Another important trend is social document management, which simplifies and streamlines workflows in the organization, particularly in relation to workflow processes. Advanced document management enables creating, editing, and sharing files within the system on the go. In other words, social functionality allows transparent communication and lets you and other users view comments, messages, and activities.</p>",
    "<p>Social document management adds great value to your organization. On one hand, it enables smoother and faster workflow, and on the other, it improves team productivity and enhances collaboration among employees.</p>",
    "<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>",
    "<p>Another trend in document management aligns with the global growth of artificial intelligence usage. The vast and critical information accumulated in document management systems can serve as fertile ground for natural language research to improve future organizational processes.</p>",
    "<p>Integrating AI into a document management system contributes to decision-making processes by predicting behavior patterns and optimizing actions and processes within the company. The bottom line: deeper insights into various aspects of the organization, drawing conclusions, and making adjustments to maximize efficiency.</p>",
    "<h2>Part of CRM</h2>",
    "<p>A very significant trend in recent years is the integration of document management systems as an integral part of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). This comes as no surprise, given how critical document management is within CRM processes.</p>",
    "<p>For example: during a negotiation between a salesperson and a client managed within CRM, the most efficient and optimal situation is when all emails and documents exchanged during the process are attached to the customer’s history card. This way, when interacting with the customer’s record, any relevant document or file is just one click away.</p>",
    "<p>Therefore, when choosing a document management system, you should consider that purchasing a standalone system without CRM integration will not be effective (especially for companies with a marketing orientation), compared to an integrated CRM + document management system working in harmony and providing the right solution for your needs.</p>",
    "<h2>Scalability</h2>",
    "<p>One of the most important capabilities of modern organizational systems is scalability—the ability to adapt to company growth (especially in times when many startups are emerging). Business growth, which dramatically increases the volume of documents and data, has required document management developers to address this challenge.</p>",
    "<p>The move to cloud-based work and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models (especially CRM systems with integrated document management) provided excellent flexibility to scale up or down, thanks to the ability to add or remove users without requiring any IT hardware investment.</p>",
    "<p>Therefore, it is highly recommended that you also consider adopting a cloud-based SaaS system. This not only gives you access to documents anytime, anywhere in real time, but also provides the critical flexibility to scale users up or down without unnecessary delays.</p>",
    "<h2>Affordable Prices</h2>",
    "<p>In the past, document management software was considered expensive—affordable only for large organizations or powerful companies. The new era signals a major shift, not only in system pricing, which has become much more accessible, but especially in the transition to the SaaS model.</p>",
    "<p>The SaaS model not only provides an entirely different pricing structure (affordable monthly fees) but also delivers a smart, advanced system comparable to those used by large organizations.</p>",
    "<p>Undoubtedly, this can give you the drive to adopt a document management system or an integrated CRM + document management solution and start optimizing your business as soon as tomorrow morning.</p>"

    "</h2>",
    "<h2>Precise customization to needs",
    "</h2>",
    "<p>One of the main characteristics of the decision-making process carried out before purchasing a customer management system is the importance of customization to needs. Israeli companies usually look at the solution or system to be purchased from the perspective of the organization and its existing workflows. In other words, businesses are less willing to change existing habits (even if they are not the most effective) in favor of slightly different workflows in the customer management system, but rather expect the software to adapt to their organization.",

    "<p>One outcome of this characteristic is that Israeli companies often choose a tailor-made solution, which over time creates significant dependence on the development company with all that this entails.",
    "</p>",
    "<h2>Cost – a key factor",
    "</h2>",
    "<p>In Israel, as we know, cost is a central factor in purchasing any product, and this also applies to customer management software/CRM systems. Although information systems are a very important solution for organizational efficiency and are much more complex than simple office equipment, an attractive price can definitely tilt the scales in favor of purchasing a particular system, not to mention free systems…",
    "</p>",
    "<h2>Less fond of monthly payments",
    "</h2>",
    "<p>In Israel, there is less enthusiasm for monthly payments, and the preference is usually to purchase products outright. This is also evident in the real estate market, where there is a preference for buying an apartment rather than renting (renting is only done when there is no possibility to purchase). This characteristic of the Israeli audience also applies to the customer management software market. Companies still prefer to purchase the software and pay annual maintenance fees rather than pay for “Software as a Service.”",
    "</p>",
    "<p>However, in this aspect, in recent years we can see a change in favor of moving to monthly payments. This change occurs due to the great development of the communications market (Internet, mobile, television) and global trends of moving to cloud services that only operate in this model, forcing consumers to change their behavior in everything related to paying for products and services.",
    "</p>",
    "<h2>Preferring the \"comfort zone\" over learning new systems",
    "</h2>",
    "<p>The subject of learning and implementation is super important for maximum efficiency of the organization after purchasing a new customer management system. Employees in Israeli companies prefer the comfort zone of the existing system, its upgrade, or a similar system, rather than learning processes and workflows different from what they were used to. Moreover, decision-makers who have moved from one company to another often try to convince the new owners to purchase the system they worked with in their previous company…",
    "</p>",
    "<h2>Choosing a safe and/or popular system",
    "</h2>",
    "<p>Another characteristic that has gained much strength in recent years is the tendency to purchase well-known/popular/safe customer management software rather than a system hardly anyone has heard of. This characteristic can certainly conflict with the desire to choose cheap and/or unknown free systems (in terms of cost) and constitutes a significant counterweight in decision-making.

    "</p>",
    "<p>In other words, make adjustments also on your side and understand the wisdom of the system. It may be difficult for you at first to make changes, but without a doubt, over time you may realize the added value it has provided you as a result of the experience and adaptations it has already made for many clients.",

  "<h2>Lead Generation – A Basic Step Toward Sales</h2>",
  "<p>One of the most important stages in the sales process is lead generation, which has become much more complex in the modern era due to the wide range of tactics for generating inquiries. In the past, we carried out telemarketing to the target audience, searched for potential customers through magazines, newspapers, directories, trade shows, and exhibitions. Today, however, capabilities have expanded tremendously to include: targeted digital mailings (e-Blasts), search engine advertising, social media marketing, online advertising, web browsing, and more.</p>",
  "<p>One of the key skills required today is the ability to generate quality leads using the right tactics for the modern era, effectively.</p>",
  "<h2>What Are the Pros and Cons of In-House Lead Generation?</h2>",
  "<p>Decision-makers in organizations naturally like to maintain control over all departments, especially when it comes to sales processes, which are essentially the company’s revenue engine.</p>",
  "<p>However, generating leads in-house is not always an economical or wise move. Lead generation in today’s era requires skilled people who know the right tactics and are also trained in preliminary calls as needed. The investments required to hire, train, and coach such a team internally can be very costly, not to mention the long time the company loses before they become professional and ready for action.</p>",
  "<p>In such cases, it is often wiser to turn to an outsourcing company that can manage the lead generation process with immediate entry into action, bringing extensive knowledge, trained professionals, and the use of smart information systems such as CRM, which enables analysis capabilities and insights for maximizing effective leads.</p>",
  "<p>An important point to consider is the team’s familiarity with the many innovative lead generation tactics available today. It is often much easier to approach an outsourcing company that specializes in this field, rather than exhaustively searching for employees who can master these tactics, apply them properly for the organization’s products, and deliver good results.</p>",
  "<p>Another factor to consider in lead generation is that an internal team often knows the products too well and assumes potential customers do as well, leading to messaging that is not always optimal for maximizing results (in any lead generation tactic). In contrast, an external outsourcing company, whose team is not directly tied to the company, communicates with potential customers as if they are genuinely new –",

  "</strong>",
  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<h2><strong>The Mobile Work Trend Is Intensifying</strong></h2>",
  "<p>If a few years ago we saw only initial changes in work patterns of organizations, companies, clients, and consumers due to the entry of smartphones, tablets, iPhones, and iPads, today it is already a reality: <strong>everyone’s center of life has shifted to mobile!</strong></p>",
  "<p>Consumer expectations have also changed, especially with regard to fast responses from anywhere. From their perspective, every company representative or decision-maker today has a smartphone and should be constantly available in the scope of their work.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Mobile CRM – Absolutely Essential for Every Company</strong></h2>",
  "<p>One of the key areas requiring serious attention to the mobile revolution is customer relationship management, especially as it focuses on managing sales and service (which involve many field agents). In this case, Mobile CRM is meant to be the primary and most important work tool for field representatives in providing prompt and effective customer service.</p>",
  "<p>Indeed, companies developing advanced CRM systems have recognized this trend and adapted their solutions to mobile field use through Mobile CRM, by developing CRM applications for smartphones and iPads, or via responsive Cloud CRM compatible with mobile devices in the field.</p>",
  "<p>This solution dramatically improves the efficiency of field representatives, allowing them to access customer history, check attributes, retrieve documents, generate reports, provide effective responses, and many more capabilities from anywhere, in real time.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Get the Most Out of Mobile CRM – and Gain Big!</strong></h2>",
  "<p>Mobile CRM is an essential work tool, and it is highly recommended to make the most of it. Here are a few tips to help you do just that:</p>",
  "<h2>Define Your Needs</h2>",
  "<p>Before choosing a Mobile CRM system, it is important to properly define your needs. Some companies require more detailed information in the field—whether for sales or service. Others need only basic data and fewer actions. Some organizations are heavily field-based, and for them, the Mobile CRM system should become their central application, tailored specifically to their needs.</p>",
  "<p>Therefore, it is highly recommended to hold a needs assessment meeting that includes your field teams. Each participant can present their needs, enabling you to consolidate a structured requirements document.</p>",
  "<h2>Choose the Right Mobile CRM System</h2>",
  "<p>Once you have defined your needs, you must select the system that best fits them. As noted, there are two main approaches to Mobile CRM:</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li><strong>A system based on developing a dedicated CRM mobile application</strong> – this approach involves creating a custom-built mobile system tailored to your specific requirements.</li>",
  "<li><strong>A responsive Cloud CRM system</strong> – this approach is based on a cloud CRM platform fully optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a good user experience in the field. The advantage of this approach is that your work in the field maintains the same depth and resolution as office CRM, in terms of actions and data retrieval.</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>It is highly recommended to carefully review the available systems, consider both approaches, and choose the right system. Remember, this is one of the most important tools in the field, and it must adequately meet your needs.</p>",
  "<h2>Provide Proper and Professional Training for Field Representatives</h2>",
  "<p>An equally important step in working with Mobile CRM is training and onboarding your field teams. Companies that invest in teaching the system and training representatives for efficient use significantly improve fieldwork effectiveness, enhance customer experience, and maximize organizational profitability.</p>",
  "<p>Therefore, after purchasing the system, it is highly recommended to invest as much as needed in training your people. It pays off big time!</p>",
  "<h2>Make Necessary Adjustments to Maximize Work Effectiveness</h2>",
  "<p>Needs assessment is important, but the true test comes in the long-term field use. The actual work of representatives with Mobile CRM will provide real insights into this tool’s efficiency in managing customer interactions. Conduct team meetings after several months to determine whether workflows are smooth enough or if there are significant issues.</p>",
  "<p>If problems are found, make operational adjustments to the system where possible. And if the application itself needs modifications, do not hesitate to invest in further development, as this is crucial for team performance and will ensure a definite return on investment.</p>",
  "<p>Do not forget, in today’s era, the main focus for companies must be customer experience. It directly impacts satisfaction, long-term loyalty, and organizational growth in revenue and profit. Mobile CRM plays a major role in this—so compromises are not an option!</p>"

  "<li>",

  "</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<h2>",
  "<strong>Why do new era trends challenge telemarketing?</strong>",
  "</h2>",
  "<ol>",
  "<li>The culture of self-search creates resistance to proactive telemarketing. Most business professionals today prefer to search for products, services, and solutions in their own time and tend to reject many telemarketing calls, which they view as interruptions in their already busy schedules.</li>",
  "</ol>",
  "<ol start=\"2\">",
  "<li>New communication tools overshadow telemarketing, positioning it as “outdated and annoying.” Decision-makers, especially in Israel, prefer using innovative tools over outdated ones.</li>",
  "</ol>",
  "<ol start=\"3\">",
  "<li>The development of digital advertising and social networks has significantly diminished the enormous power telemarketing held at the end of the last century. Today’s advanced marketing capabilities offer innovative options that are just as effective, if not more.</li>",
  "</ol>",
  "<h2>",
  "<strong>Is telemarketing still relevant in the new era?</strong>",
  "</h2>",
  "<p>A common question for many decision-makers (particularly those from the older generation) is whether telemarketing remains relevant today.</p>",
  "<p>The short answer is yes—telemarketing is still a vital tool, as long as it is operated in a way that aligns with the current behavioral patterns of the business world.</p>",
  "<p>Below are the defining features of telemarketing adapted to the new era we live in:</p>",
  "<h2>Inbound telemarketing gains more weight than outbound</h2>",
  "<p>A key feature of modern telemarketing is the strengthening of call centers for inbound calls—handling responses from advertisements and campaigns—while outbound telemarketing has become less prominent. This shift is a direct result of the “Pull” method replacing the proactive “Push” approach that was highly popular in the 1990s.</p>",
  "<p>The “Pull” method, derived from modern advertising tactics, generates leads for the company, leaving telemarketing with the role of properly handling them and converting them into sales calls.</p>",
  "<h2>Outbound telemarketing to new customers requires true professionalism</h2>",
  "<p>Another adaptation to the new era is the professionalism required from telemarketing teams conducting outbound calls. Consumer behavior patterns, particularly the emphasis on self-research and endless online exposure, have made people increasingly resistant to telemarketing. It is often perceived as a disturbance…</p>",
  "<p>Therefore, telemarketing agents must demonstrate greater professionalism—not only in identifying the right prospects still open to telemarketing, but also in timing calls effectively and using impactful conversation scripts.</p>",
  "<p>An advanced CRM system can greatly enhance results by analyzing customer history and characteristics, enabling adjustments that optimize calls and maximize sales.</p>",
  "<h2>Telemarketing becomes flexible and multi-channel</h2>",
  "<p>Another important feature of telemarketing today stems from the multi-channel communication revolution (emails, SMS, WhatsApp, live chats, social media) and the shift from calls to written communication. Telemarketing operations are now adapting to initiate and respond not only through phone calls but also through whichever communication channel best suits each customer.</p>",
  "<p>This evolution is expressed in the transition of call centers into multi-channel systems, enabling representatives to interact with customers in the channels they use most frequently. Engaging with customers through their preferred channels enhances interpersonal communication and maximizes results.</p>",
  "<h2>Proactive telemarketing for existing customers works wonders</h2>",
  "<p>Proactive telemarketing for existing customers is crucial for customer retention and profit growth. It can contribute in several ways:</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li><strong>Classic customer retention</strong> – Telemarketing designed to build stronger personal connections with existing customers, thereby improving long-term loyalty.</li>",
  "<li><strong>Handling product or solution issues</strong> – Telemarketing aimed at easing dissatisfaction when a product issue arises for existing customers (and potentially upselling add-ons or complementary solutions).</li>",
  "<li><strong>Business opportunities</strong> – Telemarketing used to present customers with innovative or unique products, creating a window of opportunity for a significant short-term sales push.</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<h2>Up-sales and cross-sales as a major revenue driver</h2>",
  "<p>Another key element is using up-sales and cross-sales as dynamic engines for generating significant revenue. The idea is to offer customers upgraded products or complementary products, as defined in professional jargon:</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li><strong>Up-sales</strong> – Selling the same type of product, but upgraded and more expensive.</li>",
  "<li><strong>Cross-sales</strong> – Selling additional complementary products from different categories alongside the existing product.</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>Proper use of cross-sales and up-sales improves not only business results but also customer retention, as it strengthens the value of the customer relationship.</p>",
  "<p>Here too, an advanced CRM system plays a vital role by segmenting target audiences through historical analysis, identifying needs, and generating insights that allow for better alignment of upgraded or complementary products with the right customers.</p>"

  "<p>",
  "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sales process of every business must be built and tailored to your target audience – groups of people characterized by age, gender, religion, browsing preferences, hobbies, and more. The goal is to identify those audiences, the types of people most likely to find your products or services attractive, thus creating high demand.

  "<p>",
  "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many ways to take care of these two aspects in your business.

  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<h2><b>What is a CRM system?</b></h2>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>",
  "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A CRM system, or Customer Relationship Management, is primarily designed to collect information about your customers, organize it efficiently, and back it up in a digital cloud such as Google Drive or Dropbox.</span>",
  "</p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<h3><strong>This essential information includes, among other things:</strong></h3>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basic customer information – their full names, birthdays, place of residence, phone number, email, sometimes even their ID number, age, and even their Facebook account.</span></li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Browsing preferences and hobbies – deeper insights about your customers, such as the websites they enjoy, the YouTube videos they watch, the groups and pages they follow on social networks, and the people they interact with on platforms like WhatsApp.</span></li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Past purchases – most of the information found in the CRM exists because those people have already interacted with you: they may have left a phone number, used your services, or purchased products. In any case, this information will be recorded in their file and significantly enhance understanding of their consumer preferences.</span></li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sensitive and critical information – anniversaries, number of children and their ages, upcoming events like a birth or a difficult family situation, socioeconomic status, workplace, and more. You can even add personal notes about customers if you’ve met them in person during a meeting, for example.</span></li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this will help you get to know your customer inside and out – more effectively than you could in several meetings.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest advantage of the CRM system is that this information is accessible to anyone you choose to grant access to in your cloud. This way, your salespeople, marketers, and anyone involved in generating and retaining your customers can benefit from the information 24/7 and incorporate it into your campaigns.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<h2><b>Managing the Sales Aspect</b></h2>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your salespeople are your first line of attraction toward customers: suitable call scripts, ads, organic and paid campaigns on websites and social networks, and even print ads or billboards – all rely on the organized data stored in your CRM system to create the most effective marketing and sales processes.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your marketing team will use the data in the CRM to profile your target audience in terms of average age, gender, demographic location, and browsing preferences. They will then create content tailored specifically for those audiences – catching customers’ attention and encouraging them to read more about you, get to know you, and ultimately purchase from you.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More aggressive sales processes, such as phone calls, job offers, or sales meetings, require much more focus and expertise in understanding the specific customer you are approaching. For your salesperson to win over customers, they need to know how to address them, learn their hobbies, and find the right words to inspire trust in your brand and eventually drive action that leads to a purchase. Importantly, the goal is not just closing a sale but opening a door for larger future purchases.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The information in the CRM will help your salespeople know your customers before a call or meeting, so they can prepare accordingly. Moreover, the personal details stored can help them stay updated on current customer circumstances—for example, congratulating them on a new baby or showing greater sensitivity following a difficult family event.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When salespeople have this information in advance, they arrive more prepared and confident, avoid awkward situations, and build deeper connections with customers much faster.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<h2><b>Managing the Customer Retention Aspect</b></h2>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, all this valuable information came into your hands and your employees’ hands thanks to your existing customers, who have already discovered you, read about you, purchased services or products from you, and are now more likely to return than new leads are to convert.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, your existing customers are the ones you should always focus on, because they already like you and have demand for your products or services. It will therefore be much easier to convince them to turn to you again.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your customer retention division can use the basic information about your customers to reach out via email, phone, and social networks. The additional information stored in the CRM helps personalize communication, including their name and referencing products or services that may specifically interest them. For example, if their anniversary or birthday is coming up, wish them congratulations and offer a discount or gift. Similarly, you can send specific offers related to items they have purchased before or complementary products that go well with their existing purchases. The chances are high that they are already interested in these products, and if the approach is warm and personal with a coincidental discount – there is over an 80% chance of securing another purchase, reinforcing future loyalty.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another option is to send universal messages to all your customers ahead of a holiday or sales period. It’s essential to inform your customers about sales and discounts—if you don’t tell them, they won’t know. Chances are that when they see promotions, they’ll be tempted to check them out and make purchases now that prices are lower.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<h2><b>Business Flexibility at Your Fingertips</b></h2>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every day, you and your employees will update your CRM system to ensure that all the information is accurate, synchronized, and as high quality as possible. With the most personal information about your customers in hand, you essentially have a map that helps you and your employees learn how to approach them and turn them into loyal returning customers.</span></p>",
  "<p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A CRM system also helps ensure that no existing customer “falls through the cracks” and that you make the most of every customer who approaches you by providing excellent service tailored to their needs.</span></p>",

      "content": [
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A CRM system, or Customer Relationship Management, is a system designed to help organizations, companies, and small businesses around the world efficiently manage their customer relationship network. It is a computerized system that provides companies with the ability to manage business relationships with their customers effectively and to control the information shared with customers exclusively.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRM systems include the contact details of existing customers as well as the contact details of “leads” – people who match your target audience and are potential customers themselves: their names, phone numbers, emails, and sometimes even their ID numbers and places of residence. All this information is entered into the CRM and stored in a single, specific location, in an organized manner. Today, this usually means digital storage such as the cloud or Google Drive. This type of storage is optimal for companies and organizations because it allows every employee in the company to view the information stored in the cloud easily, efficiently, and as soon as it is entered into the system.</span></p>",

    "<h2><b>Customer retention is an essential backbone of every business</b></h2>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customer retention process is what contributes most to the profitability of the business, more than any other promotional process. Why? Because it’s about warm, personal outreach to customers who have already purchased from you — people who know you, are satisfied with you, and are very likely to buy from you again soon because they trust your brand.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, when you already have customers who purchased from you, you also have broader information about them: what they purchased reveals their personal preferences, you have their email, phone number, and home address, so you have extensive access to them from every direction.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to this information, you can entice these customers to return and purchase from you more easily. For example, if your customers purchased a computer or television, it is very likely that they will also need a wireless mouse and keyboard, maybe a universal remote, or even special cleaning tools for electronic devices, or surge protectors to prevent damage from power outages.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRM systems help you automatically send this information to customers, so they will discover, fall in love, and over time — become loyal, long-term customers.</span></p>",

    "<h2><b>Today, CRM systems are also tailored for small businesses</b></h2>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A CRM system is designed to create a pleasant user experience and improve collaboration between employees in the company. Using it significantly contributes to the operations of countless organizations today. However, until recent years, CRM systems were mostly suitable only for large companies, requiring powerful servers and extensive ongoing maintenance. Small business owners often showed hesitation about using such an intensive system.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2014, CRM systems have provided a simpler, lighter infrastructure for small businesses: systems that require a lower monthly cost, run on more standard servers, and do not require constant maintenance, unlike the larger, original systems.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to these changes, today many small business owners are turning to enjoy the benefits of CRM: the efficiency with which it consolidates customer information, ease of use, customer profiling, and the exceptional ability to maintain optimal customer service. All of this leads to a significant rise in the company’s reputation and many satisfied customers who contribute to word-of-mouth marketing and remain loyal over the years.</span></p>",

    "<h2><b>A CRM system improves communication between employees</b></h2>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In large companies, usually each employee has a very specific area of responsibility, with several people forming a dedicated department working together in different aspects toward the same goal.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In smaller businesses, most of the time it is essentially one large department, divided among a small number of people performing a wide range of tasks and responsibilities. As a result, these employees are more overloaded and need more organization and efficient ways to synchronize with their colleagues. Since everyone performs similar tasks, there is a lot of overlapping information and shared assignments that must be carried out separately but completed together.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In situations where everyone needs to be synchronized but everyone is under pressure, it is not easy to maintain high-quality and coherent communication. However, when all the information is in one place and accessible to every employee, the work process becomes far more efficient: eliminating the need for constant communication allows employees to stay focused and concentrate on their assignments. In addition, they save time that would otherwise be wasted looking for colleagues who may have just gone on a break or stepped away...</span></p>",

    "<h2><b>Significant savings in time and money</b></h2>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, every action your employees had to take required a lot of time: writing a letter, receiving a reply from another organization, or even generating reports — these tasks would take your employees hours or even entire days. Today, technology allows these tasks to be completed efficiently and even automatically, saving your employees a significant amount of time and saving your business a large amount of money.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, instead of sending letters, your employees send emails. And thanks to systems like CRM, these emails can even be sent to your regular customers automatically — saving your employees countless hours of unnecessary grunt work.</span></p>",

    "<h2><b>A CRM system records your employees’ activities</b></h2>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is essential to evaluate the average productivity of your employees: if you are unaware of their true capabilities, their investment or lack of investment during the workday, you will not know how to manage them effectively.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A CRM system helps you easily track the exact productivity of each employee in your company: how many sales were made today and by whom, how many phone calls were made and by whom, how long each call lasted, what are the average waiting times in your customer service department, and more.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kind of knowledge is worth gold: it helps you identify lazy employees, encourage high-performing ones, and properly onboard new hires...</span></p>"

      "title": "How to Handle Customer Objections",
      "content": [
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer objections are among the most challenging and burdensome phenomena in any business. Today, in an era where the entire Western world is well connected to the digital world, it is not simple at all to succeed and entice consumers to turn to you — specifically to you — in a world full of businesses, companies, and corporations.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a world overflowing with countless businesses, most consumers are already committed to a particular brand in one way or another: they already have a TV cable provider, a preferred computer company, a popular mobile company, a regular lawyer, and even a digital marketing service provider on social media whom they trust the most.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even when you overcome this obstacle, you still face countless objections from the customers themselves: what can you say to customers who claim they don’t have money? Or those who simply aren’t interested in hearing from you?</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you convert the customer to your company? How can you motivate them to choose you specifically?</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>Who is your customer?</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To overcome the many objections your customer may present, the smartest thing you can do is resolve them in their minds before they even arise. The moment you provide your customers with reliable and high-quality answers, they will feel confident making the purchase through you and choosing you, so far fewer objections will surface.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All you need to do is study your customers and profile them properly — from A to Z: discover their average age, what they like, their browsing preferences, their hobbies, their family status, their socioeconomic status, and of course — all the ways to contact them, whether through Facebook, phone, home address, or email.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have all this essential information, you can develop a quality marketing strategy that helps ease your customers’ objections by providing thoughtful responses, phrased in a way that conveys personal confidence according to their linguistic preferences.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>How does your customer prefer to be approached?</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After defining your customers, it is worthwhile to find out how they prefer to be approached. Before determining the style of your message or advertisement, first ask yourself: <i>where</i> should you reach out to them?</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as there are young people who are connected to Instagram 24/7, there are older people who do not like the digital world at all and still read their news in newspapers and learn about companies and corporations through ads and television. Everything depends on the age and lifestyle of the audience you are addressing: while an older audience will prefer phone calls and traditional communication channels, a younger audience will prefer SMS, email, or Facebook messages. When you know where your target audience “hangs out” intellectually, you can focus your outreach methods, save money on ineffective approaches, and gain loyal customers from the right advertising channels.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve established the right channel, it’s highly recommended to invest a great deal of thought into how you address your customers. The more professional and significant the topic — such as medicine, law, or IT — the more you should maintain a professional and high-level language, creating the impression that you are experts in the field, and that when they choose you, they will be in good hands. In contrast, when it comes to lighter topics such as product purchases or service offerings to promote companies, you should maintain a younger, professional, and warmer tone that encourages the audience to feel that they are approaching a company that puts them at the top of its priorities and offers personal, friendly service.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every target audience has its preferred communication style. Today’s younger generation, for instance, prefers quick and precise messages rather than approaches focused on objections or unnecessary questions. Take advantage of this and avoid long phone conversations or face-to-face meetings that open the door to unnecessary objections, which may drive them away from the deal.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you know your customers prefer meetings or phone calls, try to anticipate the objections that may arise so you can address them confidently and effectively — motivating them to choose you. Many companies today build detailed call scripts to ensure that when their salespeople reach out to customers, all the answers to possible questions are already well-rehearsed. Quick and confident responses will make your customers feel you are true experts, and this will lead to closing deals.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>How can you retain your customer in the long term?</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you’ve successfully responded to all objections using the wealth of information you have about your customers: you profiled them properly, built a call framework that leads to sales, and learned how to respond to every question with confidence and care. Excellent. Now, the only thing left is to ensure that when your customers say “yes,” it will be one of many more “yeses” to come.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, once the product is purchased, the subscription ends, or the warranty expires, you know that your existing customers have once again become potential customers — and it’s much easier to entice them to buy from you again.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your customers already know you, have purchased products or services from you, and had a positive experience, the chances are higher that they will return when the specific need you provide arises again. Still, it’s advisable to encourage them in this direction — through emails, messages, and promotions that may interest them, holiday or birthday greetings, and checking in to ensure they are satisfied with your service.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, one day, those same satisfied customers may suddenly decide to back out — because the warranty is too short, the price is too high, or they simply “changed their mind.” These are objections where knowing your customers well is critical, as the answers you provide at these moments can transform them from dissatisfied clients into loyal, long-term ones.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When such situations occur, make sure to listen carefully and examine whether your customers’ socioeconomic situation has changed, whether they are going through a crisis, or if they simply need a gesture that makes them feel special. Once you give them the feeling that they are personally important to your business, they will realize it’s worth staying with you — because you care for them and their needs at all times.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>The secret lies in the quality of your information</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these profiles, call scripts, and quality communication methods are learned thanks only to the information you hold about your customers. This information helps you deeply understand your customers, their world, and their preferences — allowing you to approach them in ways that resonate and lead to closing deals.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more reliable, extensive, and organized the information you have, the greater the chances you can prevent objections in advance and learn to provide optimal answers to expected ones confidently as they arise.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, you can save countless hours of your and your employees’ work through a CRM system (Customer Relationship Management) that consolidates all the information you have about your customers “under one roof.” Instead of hiring staff to input data across multiple platforms, you can enter it once in real time. The data stored in the system is backed up by digital cloud services and accessible to anyone who needs it — whether it’s your sales division, marketing, customer retention team, or yourself.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The accessible and complete data about your customers helps all your employees learn and optimally profile your customers so that each one, in their sector, can respond patiently and confidently — leading to more closed deals.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, a CRM system also helps ensure that no customer “falls through the cracks” and that everyone receives thoughtful, quality responses.</span></p>"

Thanks to purchase history, the retention team can send customers (via email, phone, WhatsApp, and social networks) relevant promotions or interest them in complementary products.

    "<p>Email marketing is not spam. It’s a personal message from you. True, you’re not a friend or family member, but you are <i>something</i> important. Customers wouldn’t hand over their information so easily unless they trusted you and liked your brand. Once you have their details, you can use them to build a deeper, more profitable relationship with your customers.</p>",
    "<p>Email is also the perfect way to encourage your customers to subscribe to your mailing list and, as a result, establish a long-term relationship. To achieve this, you need to provide relevant and valuable content—something connected to your products or services, or simply content that resonates with them as your target audience. While the ultimate goal is, of course, to drive repeat purchases, the main focus is always on your customers’ needs and interests.</p>",

    "<h2><b>The Benefits of Email Marketing</b></h2>",

    "<li><b>Builds relationships</b> – Creates a personal connection between your brand and your customers, encouraging engagement and commitment.</li>",
    "<li><b>Increases brand awareness</b> – The more emails you send, the more your company leaves its mark. A recognizable brand is a stronger, more popular brand.</li>",
    "<li><b>Provides customer insights</b> – Share relevant blog posts or branded content through email, and always include options for customers to leave more details. This helps you reach them on other platforms like phone, Facebook, or additional social channels.</li>",
    "<li><b>Promotes products</b> – Send promotional emails with discounts or offers on products your customers already love.</li>",
    "<li><b>Delivers valuable content</b> – Create content that educates and empowers customers, making them more likely to turn to you for future decisions.</li>",

    "<h2><b>It All Starts at the Beginning</b></h2>",
    "<p>If you want to build a strong, effective email campaign, follow these steps:</p>",
    "<h2><b>Develop a Strategy</b></h2>",
    "<p>The average customer receives 121 emails every day. Without a clear strategy, your emails may get lost in the crowd—or worse, land in the spam folder where no one looks.</p>",
    "<p>A good strategy means sending consistent, relevant content. The goal is to deliver information your audience actually wants to read. It takes time to figure out the right content, but these steps will help you create a powerful, engaging strategy:</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li><b>Define your audience</b> – Quality emails are always relevant to their readers. Like all marketing, start with your customer persona: understand who they are, what they want, and how they decide to make a purchase. Then, design campaigns that match their needs.</li>",
    "<li><b>Set clear goals</b> – Do your research before setting campaign objectives. Look at email statistics and analyze what works for your audience—and for others in your industry. Learn from what has succeeded elsewhere and use it to create an even stronger, more original approach.</li>",
    "<li><b>Collect customer emails</b> – You can’t run email campaigns without a mailing list. Build your list through loyalty programs, website sign-ups, or simple opt-in forms. Remember, customers must give permission to receive your content. Even if your list is small, don’t worry—everyone starts somewhere, and a quality list takes time to grow.</li>",
    "<li><b>Choose your campaign type</b> – Newsletters, product launch announcements, educational content—there are many options. The right type depends on your audience. Do they love weekly newsletters? Do they react to special offers? Use your research and testing to guide the decision.</li>",
    "<li><b>Create a schedule</b> – Consistency is key. Sending emails on the same day each week builds anticipation and trust. Plan your email calendar in advance and let your subscribers know when to expect you.</li>",
    "<li><b>Measure results</b> – The true purpose of email is to drive action. Use analytics tools to track open rates, click-through rates, and conversions. Test what works, refine your approach, and adapt your strategy to keep improving results.</li>",

For physical services, even a small gift or access to a free loyalty program in return for an email address can be highly effective.</p>",
    "<p>Always emphasize that your content, offers, or membership will truly benefit their lives. Provide practical, easy-to-apply insights that solve real problems. Then, keep the promise by sending more helpful content, offering promotions, and recommending products they’re likely to love.</p>",

    "<p>A CRM system makes managing all this information simple. It organizes customer data so your team can access it easily, helps you design personalized and engaging emails, and generates statistics to track whether your strategy is working. With CRM, you don’t just attract new customers—you nurture and strengthen the bond with your most valuable ones: your existing customers.</p>"

      "title": "How CRM Improves the Customer Experience",
      "content": [
    "<p>CRM systems allow companies and businesses worldwide to develop effective strategies for managing their customer relationships. The system enhances communication with existing customers and encourages the creation of the right marketing funnels to bring in new, high-quality customers.</p>",
    "<p>One of the greatest advantages of CRM is that it improves the customer experience: the shopping experience, the browsing experience, the persuasion experience—all become more engaging and better tailored to your target audience’s personality. Customer experience is an integral part of any business’s success.</p>",
    "<p>The better the customer experience, the higher their satisfaction. Customers develop trust and loyalty toward your brand, making them more likely to return, to choose you when they need something, and to be tempted by your promotions or special offers.</p>",
    "<p>A CRM system helps you achieve this experience—and much more.</p>",
    "<h2><b>All Information Under One Roof</b></h2>",
    "<p>The biggest advantage of a CRM system is its ability to gather vast amounts of information in a user-friendly way.</p>",
    "<p>Every time a customer makes a purchase, you and your employees gain valuable insights: their full name, address, email, phone number, and more.</p>",
    "<p>Deeper market research can provide even more details: Facebook and Instagram profiles, browsing and purchasing preferences, birthdays, marital status, financial situation, and so on.</p>",
    "<p>All this information is stored in the CRM system—usually backed up in the cloud or on a private server—to ensure it’s preserved indefinitely.</p>",
    "<p>Any employee with login access can use this information to enhance the customer experience. Sales teams, customer retention staff, and marketing departments all rely on this data to design personalized sales processes that match each customer’s personality and encourage ongoing engagement.</p>",
    "<p>CRM systems also generate statistics and forecasts from this data. These insights help employees assess whether sales processes truly maximize customer experience—and refine them further for even better results.</p>",
    "<h2><b>Stay Connected with Customers</b></h2>",
    "<p>Robust CRM platforms include marketing automation tools, enabling businesses to send regular, automated communications to their customers.</p>",
    "<p>Most CRM systems integrate with email platforms, allowing you to send promotional content effortlessly.</p>",
    "<p>You can deliver a wide range of emails: newsletters, promotions, renewal notices, tips, and engagement-driven content. Customers value these emails because they’re tailored to their personal needs.</p>",
    "<p>For example, CRM systems personalize emails by addressing customers by name. Research shows that 62% of customers are more likely to open an email when it’s addressed to them personally.</p>",
    "<p>CRM systems also provide ready-to-use templates that match the tone and style of your target audience. These templates save time while ensuring quality, professional content.</p>",
    "<p>In addition, CRM systems can send personalized emails that highlight each customer’s importance to you—birthday or anniversary greetings, product recommendations based on recent purchases, or exclusive offers. These personalized touches make customers feel valued and special, strengthening their trust and loyalty toward your brand.</p>",
    "<h2><b>A Consistent Experience</b></h2>",
    "<p>CRM systems enable you and your team to schedule communications on a consistent basis. Regular messaging builds trust and sets an expectation for weekly or monthly emails, increasing the likelihood that customers will open and engage with your content.</p>",
    "<p>Consistency also creates a seamless experience. CRMs can send automatic emails after a purchase, request feedback after a set period, remind customers of abandoned carts, or re-engage them with products they viewed before. This consistency drives repeat visits and purchases.</p>",
    "<p>Thanks to regular and reliable communication, customers see your business as a strong, trustworthy brand worth returning to.</p>",
    "<h2><b>Deliver Relevant Content</b></h2>",
    "<p>The wealth of data stored in a CRM system allows you to know your customers on a personal level. This enables you to create engaging, targeted content that resonates with them and encourages further interaction.</p>",
    "<p>For example, if your site sells decorative soaps, you can publish articles on how to make them, the benefits of natural ingredients, or the origins of specific materials. The more you spark curiosity, the more customers will return to your site to learn—and to shop.</p>",
    "<h2><b>Attract New Customers</b></h2>",
    "<p>The data, statistics, and forecasts stored in your CRM system are shared across your teams: marketing, sales, and customer retention.</p>",
    "<p>Each department relies on this information to define customer profiles and deliver precise, personalized experiences.</p>",
    "<p>Accurate customer profiling helps your salespeople adjust scripts for phone calls or in-store visits, fine-tune your website’s language, optimize social media content, and even prepare for key meetings with major clients.</p>",
    "<p>The goal is to ensure potential customers enjoy your content, engage with your brand, and ultimately convert—whether that’s scheduling a meeting, making a call, or placing an order.</p>",
    "<p>CRM insights also guide your employees in how best to interact with customers to close deals—whether over the phone or face-to-face. Understanding hobbies, financial status, family situation, and motivations allows salespeople to connect authentically and effectively.</p>",
    "<p>After the sale, retention begins. Customer retention teams benefit from CRM-driven scripts that instill trust and encourage repeat business.</p>",
    "<p>With CRM, your customer experience improves dramatically through simple, automated processes. The system helps you retain existing customers and attract new ones by creating a network of data, forecasts, and insights that reveal who your real audiences are and how to approach them effectively.</p>",
    "<p>CRM systems deliver immense value to businesses of all sizes. Their data and efficiency ensure that your customers receive a seamless, high-quality experience—every time.</p>"

      "content": [
    "<ul>",
    "<li><span>The introductory meeting with a client is your best opportunity to gather all the essential information needed to build a strong, long-term, and productive relationship.</span></li>",
    "<li><span>An effective sales strategy creates a relaxed atmosphere and lays the foundation for a lasting relationship with the client.</span></li>",
    "<li><span>There are certain questions you must ask in order to build a complete client profile. This ensures the client receives the most professional and relevant proposal for their needs—whether during the first call or later with the sales team.</span></li>",
    "<li><span>Proper information management, supported by a CRM system, allows you to share insights from the client interview quickly, clearly, and efficiently with the entire company.</span></li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<h2><b>Sales Calls Are the Engine of Your Business</b></h2>",
    "<p>The search for new clients is a critical process for every business. At the end of the day, customers are the fuel that drives growth. That’s why every conversation with a potential client should be maximized—especially the first one, where the foundation of the relationship is built. During this initial call, you can already gather vital knowledge about the client: their role in the company, the nature of the business, and the goals that led them to seek your services.</p>",
    "<p>To fully meet a client’s needs and create a long-term relationship, you must conduct an in-depth client interview. The purpose of this is to collect as much information as possible about the client’s business activities and the challenges they face. This way, you can present your services and products in the most relevant and tailored manner.</p>",
    "<h2><b>A Professional Interview Should Feel Relaxed</b></h2>",
    "<p>To make the introductory interview successful, you need a clear strategy. The approach your representatives take will determine the effectiveness of every engagement with a new client. The most important rule for a first meeting that includes an interview is to minimize the sense of being “interrogated.” Nobody—especially a new client—wants to feel scrutinized under a magnifying glass.</p>",
    "<p>At the same time, your goal is to align your services as closely as possible with the client’s needs. This requires understanding them in depth—their expectations, challenges, and goals. It’s a fine line between interrogation and a pleasant conversation, and you must remain mindful of it. Pay attention to body language or tone of voice, as these may reveal discomfort. Recognizing these signals and adapting the flow of questions accordingly is what ensures a successful interview.</p>",
    "<h2><b>6 Questions You Must Ask in the First Conversation with a New Client</b></h2>",
    "<p>There is key information you should always aim to gather during a client interview. Early in the conversation, try to get answers to these six essential questions:</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li><span><b>What is the company’s field of activity?</b> — Starting with an open-ended question helps ease the conversation and provides rich insights. Paying close attention to details can uncover valuable information right from the start.</span></li>",
    "<li><span><b>What is the client’s role and responsibility?</b> — Understanding how involved they are in the company’s core operations helps you gauge their influence on decision-making. There’s a big difference between speaking to an operations VP and a department manager.</span></li>",
    "<li><span><b>How does the company operate on a daily basis?</b> — This information helps you tailor your services or products to their needs. A clear picture of day-to-day operations reveals pain points—even if they’re not explicitly stated.</span></li>",
    "<li><span><b>What challenges is the company facing?</b> — Avoid making assumptions. A direct question often uncovers multiple issues, giving you the opportunity to expand the scope of services you can offer.</span></li>",
    "<li><span><b>What are the company’s short- and long-term goals?</b> — Once you know the challenges, it’s crucial to understand expectations for the future. Combining goals with obstacles helps you propose comprehensive solutions.</span></li>",
    "<li><span><b>What does the client consider a success—or a failure?</b> — This defines their expectations clearly. Even without specific ideas in mind, you’ll know exactly what outcome will satisfy them.</span></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Remember: every client interview is different. Tailor the type, sequence, and number of questions to the client you’re speaking with.</p>",
    "<h2><b>Managing Interview Data with an Advanced CRM System</b></h2>",
    "<p>After gathering initial information in the interview, you’re left with a large volume of details about the client’s business. Proper documentation is critical—especially with new clients. Most employees won’t have been part of the interview, so a centralized system is essential.</p>",
    "<p>This is where a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system comes in. Its role is to organize and display all client information efficiently. It allows you to manage client relationships over time across multiple touchpoints—whether contract signing or daily interactions with service staff. Every interaction is logged in detail.</p>",
    "<p>By entering the new client into the CRM after the interview, you lay the foundation for long-term collaboration and ensure every employee can get to know the client as thoroughly as you do.</p>",
    "<h2><b>The Ultimate Interview Ends with a Signed Contract</b></h2>",
    "<p>A positive, non-intrusive interview can have significant potential for your business. Often, clients—especially in face-to-face meetings—are ready to sign a contract with a company that conducts a professional, respectful interview. While it requires attention to detail and a thoughtful approach, the payoff can be substantial. That said, some clients may prefer to take their time and review your offer internally—and that’s perfectly valid.</p>"

      "content": [
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we all carry a digital companion in our hands — the smartphone. For this reason, SMS marketing is one of the most effective and worthwhile methods of reaching customers, with a very high chance that your message will actually be read.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real question, however, is whether the SMS you send will delight your customer — or annoy them?</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you make sure it’s the former? By following the right marketing strategies that help you craft messages that feel personal, engaging, and irresistible.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this article, we’ll explore what SMS marketing really is, why it’s so valuable, and how to run optimized campaigns that drive real sales.</span></p>",

    "<h2><b>What Is SMS Marketing?</b></h2>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses today send SMS messages to customers as part of their marketing efforts. Brands can reach potential leads, existing clients, and their entire target audience to encourage purchases, spark conversations, and boost brand awareness.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SMS marketing can take countless forms: discount coupons, flash sale announcements, contests or raffles, personalized birthday greetings, anniversary wishes, and more. Each of these sparks customer interest in your products or services in a different way.</span></p>",

    "<h2><b>The Benefits of SMS Marketing</b></h2>",

    "<h3><b>Instant Delivery</b></h3>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SMS is the fastest channel: within seconds, countless customers check their phones to see who messaged them. Studies show that 90% of SMS messages are read within the first three minutes of delivery. That means you can run limited-time sales, set specific-day promotions, or trigger real-time campaigns that drive immediate action.</span></p>",

    "<h3><b>Exceptionally High Open Rates</b></h3>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SMS stands out on a customer’s device. Around 98% of all text messages are opened, compared to only about 20% of marketing emails. With emails and social notifications buried among dozens of messages, your chance of standing out is slim — but with SMS, customers are far more likely to notice and engage.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since SMS is usually associated with close contacts like friends and family, recipients are naturally inclined to open and check who’s reaching out. Most phones also preview message content right on the lock screen, so even if they don’t open the SMS, your message is already seen.</span></p>",

    "<h3><b>Higher Response Rates</b></h3>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not just about opens — SMS drives action. Nearly 45% of recipients reply to or take action from promotional texts. That’s a huge indicator of campaign effectiveness, helping you refine strategies and improve results with every message sent.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because texting feels natural and lightweight, customers are more comfortable responding. This leads to stronger engagement, better relationships, and ultimately more sales.</span></p>",

    "<h2><b>Best Practices for SMS Marketing</b></h2>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To impress customers with compelling, valuable, and respectful SMS campaigns, keep the following tips in mind:</span></p>",

    "<h3><b>Always Ask Permission</b></h3>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because you have a customer’s phone number doesn’t mean you can message them. Beyond the fact that unsolicited texts may harm your brand image, sending SMS without consent is simply not legal. Always get permission first.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offer incentives like exclusive content or discounts to encourage opt-ins. Most customers will be happy to receive texts, as it’s a convenient channel to stay updated on offers and news.</span></p>",

    "<h3><b>Use the Right Tools</b></h3>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t send texts manually from your phone. Instead, use SMS marketing platforms or CRM systems that allow you to segment audiences, personalize content, schedule delivery, and automate follow-ups.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These systems also help track open rates, responses, and conversions, so you can continually improve campaign effectiveness.</span></p>",

    "<h3><b>Deliver Real Value</b></h3>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never send a message just for the sake of sending one. Customers expect your texts to offer something meaningful — whether it’s a discount, exclusive news, or a personalized recommendation.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more your customers feel special and valued, the more they’ll trust your brand and be motivated to buy.</span></p>",

    "<h3><b>Personalize Every Message</b></h3>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Address customers by their first name, reference their past purchases or location, and tailor offers to their specific interests. The more relevant the message feels, the higher the chance they’ll respond.</span></p>",

    "<h3><b>Keep It Short</b></h3>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SMS is meant to be quick and concise. Start with a clear subject — “Flash Sale,” “Exclusive Coupon,” or “Special Invite.” Keep details minimal and link to your website or landing page for more information. Once a customer clicks through, you’ve already gained their engagement.</span></p>",

    "<h3><b>Timing Is Everything</b></h3>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leverage timing to your advantage. Send promotional texts around holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, or shopping events like Black Friday. Well-timed messages feel more relevant and are far more likely to convert.</span></p>",

      "title": "Is the Client Ready to Buy From You? 6 Questions to Help You Find Out",
      "content": [
    "<p><span>When you’re standing in front of a client in a store or at a meeting, you’re offering a very specific product or service. The client may seem excited and interested, but are they actually ready to make a purchase?</span></p>",
    "<p><span>Don’t hesitate—ask your potential clients the following questions to find out whether they’re likely to buy from you or whether it may end up being a waste of time.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>1. \"How have these clients tried to overcome these challenges in the past?\"</b></h2>",
    "<p><span>Whether you’re selling electronics, design services, or legal advice, most of your prospects will have already tried to solve their problem in other ways before turning to you. </span></p>",
    "<p><span>For example, someone who wants to redesign their home might first try doing it themselves and creating their own unique style without hiring a designer. Think about it: when problems arise in your own life, you usually try to solve them yourself in the most cost-effective way possible. The follow-up question here is, of course: \"What were the results?\"</span></p>",
    "<p><span>Often, their answer will help you understand your chances of closing the deal. If their attempt failed—especially if the issue is urgent—they’ll be far more likely to turn to you for a professional solution. On the other hand, if the client is satisfied with their DIY results, they may not see the value in hiring a professional.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>2. \"Why is this product or service a priority <i>now</i>?\"</b></h2>",
    "<p><span>Urgent clients—the ones who truly need your solution immediately—are usually the ones most likely to buy. But why now? Often, it’s due to specific events or deadlines. A bride needs her wedding dress on time, homeowners want their interior design completed before a housewarming, and business owners need marketing advice before a clearance sale. These time-sensitive needs push clients to act quickly.</span></p>",
    "<p><span>On the other hand, when urgency is lacking, clients are more likely to compare, shop around, and postpone the purchase decision. These are the ones less likely to close right away.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>3. \"How committed are you to making this change?\"</b></h2>",
    "<p><span>Some products or services involve a major change in the client’s life or business. A redesigned home, for instance, completely alters their daily living environment. Asking about their level of commitment helps you distinguish between someone who’s just exploring and someone ready to sign a contract now.</span></p>",
    "<p><span>Avoid mentioning your product directly here—the goal is to highlight the change itself. If they strongly value the transformation, you can later position your solution as the best way to achieve it.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>4. \"Are you willing to invest your own effort to get the most out of this product or service?\"</b></h2>",
    "<p><span>Most solutions today don’t end with a payment. Clients often need to invest time in learning, adapting, and applying changes. For example, a design client must choose colors, furniture, and share their personal style with the designer. Without this commitment, the project risks stalling or failing altogether.</span></p>",
    "<p><span>Asking this upfront helps you avoid clients who lack dedication—and saves you wasted time. Conversely, committed clients will appreciate the question, as it shows you’re invested in building a stable, successful partnership.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>5. \"On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to buy this product?\"</b></h2>",
    "<p><span>A client may seem enthusiastic, but enthusiasm can fade quickly. This question reveals their true readiness. Most serious prospects will rate themselves between 7 and 9. A lower number often indicates the product isn’t a real priority for them right now.</span></p>",
    "<p><span>To increase urgency, highlight what they stand to lose if they don’t move forward. For example, if they skip redesigning their home, they may end up living in a space that feels uninspiring and uncomfortable.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>6. \"What’s your action plan?\"</b></h2>",
    "<p><span>If a client is truly ready to buy, they’ll usually have already researched, compared, and decided on a course of action. Serious buyers often come with a plan—how they’ll implement the solution and what results they expect.</span></p>",
    "<p><span>Clients who haven’t thought ahead may still be on the fence. This is the perfect moment to step in: outline the process, emphasize the advantages, and help them visualize themselves already enjoying the benefits of your solution. The more vividly they can imagine using your product, the closer you are to closing the deal.</span></p>"

      "content": [
    "<ul>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">",
    "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Client disappearance can happen for many reasons, but it requires a patient and professional response—starting from the very first meeting.</span>",
    "</li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">",
    "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating open communication channels and understanding the client’s schedule allows you to get timely responses without interrupting their daily workflow.</span>",
    "</li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">",
    "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a CRM system to document project timelines and client communication preferences helps foster positive relationships and effective communication.</span>",
    "</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, without meaning to, you may find that certain clients stop answering, responding, or engaging with you during critical points in a project. In professional terms, this is called “client disappearance.” While it’s unpleasant, it usually stems from very real reasons. Many businesses today operate with small teams and heavy workloads, which can drastically impact how quickly clients are able to respond. Remember: every disappearance has a cause—you need to understand it to provide the right solution.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When communication breaks down, it can be frustrating and may affect the entire project. But the opportunity to open a channel of communication is still in your hands—as long as you act professionally. Empathy and positive communication are the keys to rebuilding trust and moving the process forward.</span></p>",
    "<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Aren’t Your Clients Responding?</span></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several explanations for unresponsive clients. Sometimes emails are overlooked or land in spam folders. Studies show that it takes the brain about a full minute to process each incoming email and trigger a response. On top of that, managing an inbox can consume an average of three hours a day—time that most people simply don’t have. So yes, lost emails can definitely lead to communication breakdowns.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many cases, your clients aren’t acting independently. They may be waiting for approval from another department or input from a colleague before getting back to you. Sometimes, they’re simply dealing with more urgent priorities that push your project down the list.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most difficult reason for client disappearance is bad news—something they’d rather avoid sharing. But don’t jump to conclusions. While you may invest 25–40% of your time into a project, clients typically dedicate just 5–10% of theirs. More often than not, they’re just overwhelmed with other day-to-day responsibilities.</span></p>",
    "<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seven Strategies to Handle Client Disappearance</span></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dealing with disappearing clients isn’t easy, but if you want to maintain consistent communication, these strategies can help:</span></p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set clear timelines – Preventing project delays requires clarity. If you anticipate delays on the client’s side, plan ahead. Share important dates in advance and explain why they matter. Clients are less likely to forget deadlines when they understand their impact.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explain the impact of delays – Don’t hesitate to make it clear: “If we don’t meet milestone X, it will be impossible to move on to milestone Y.” When clients see the consequences, they’re more likely to cooperate.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use day-based timelines – Instead of fixed dates, frame deadlines in terms of days: “Stage X will be delivered within five days of our meeting.” This makes timelines easier for clients to visualize and harder to ignore.</span></li>",

Don’t assume. A clear and consistent channel increases responsiveness in almost any situation.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain continuity – Just like setting a second date, always confirm the next meeting before wrapping up the current one. Leaving it vague only creates extra work later. A clear sequence of meetings streamlines communication.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a fallback plan – During conversations, ask how you can proceed if they don’t respond in time. For example: “If we don’t hear from you within X days, how would you like us to move forward?” This not only helps you plan but also builds trust by showing responsibility on your part.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know your client’s schedule – Respect their availability. If they’re on vacation or busy with family, pushing work-related issues will only backfire. Understanding their rhythms allows you to provide better service and prevents the feeling that they’ve “disappeared.”</span></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using CRM to Know Your Client</span></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To build smoother client relationships and minimize disappearances, use your CRM system. It provides every team member with full, detailed client information—from contact details to call logs. With professional use, CRM helps prevent client disappearance by documenting preferred communication methods, tracking project timelines, and sending reminders to keep everything on schedule.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conclusion, there’s no reason for a client to vanish as long as you respect their communication preferences, remain clear and direct in your requests, and maintain full transparency throughout the process.</span></p>"

Before the meeting, clarify your main objectives and how you can provide the best solution for the client. Learn about the client, their needs, competitors, and even their long-term goals. A deep understanding of the client’s organizational structure is the first step toward delivering comprehensive solutions.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Client information doesn’t appear out of nowhere. In many businesses, data is managed through a professional CRM system. This system can hold everything you’ve learned about the client—across all interaction levels, from service reps to company executives. By making the most of your CRM, you can uncover insights about the client’s customer base, build conversation scenarios, and craft service proposals accordingly. Tactical preparation before the first meeting is an essential part of building fruitful, long-lasting collaborations.</span></p>",

If you’re presenting one of your services, understand how it can improve the client’s work environment and help them solve key challenges. This thought process will allow you to create a strategy that motivates the client to choose your service. Ultimately, your most important task before the meeting is to craft a tailored action plan.

    "<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Your CRM Effectively to Deliver Results</span></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main role of your CRM is to present a clear, detailed view of everything you know about the client. Even from the initial call, the client file begins to fill with details about their business activity, organizational structure, and key needs. This creates a goldmine of information you can leverage in your preparation. For example, if a client shared challenges during an introductory call and your team documented them in the CRM, you can use that information to shape your proposals. By doing so, you can suggest practical ways your services may improve their business operations—an excellent starting point that can make a strong first impression.</span></p>",

    "<ol>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create an action plan – As mentioned, preparation is critical. Document your ideas, scenarios, and initial proposals in writing. Presenting them from a written plan shows professionalism and dedication. Clients respond positively to this level of effort. Adjust your proposal as the conversation develops to reach mutual understanding.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anticipate objections – Most meetings include some form of client resistance. With many competitors in the market, clients often do their own research before meeting with you. Expect tough questions, prepare based on past experiences, and align your answers with the client’s real needs. This preparation builds trust and credibility.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allow time for reflection – While you may want quick results, pressuring a client to decide immediately can backfire. Give them enough time to review the proposal carefully and consult with other stakeholders. This responsible, patient approach fosters trust and can pay off in the long term.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Show confidence – Confidence is a winning card in business. When presenting your proposal, demonstrate calmness and belief in your solution. If you appear doubtful, the client will sense it, leading to mistrust or rejection of your offer.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practice active listening – Preparation is crucial, but don’t deliver a rigid sales pitch. In face-to-face conversations, new insights often emerge. Pay attention, listen carefully, and adapt your solution to the client’s real concerns. <b>The best meetings are the ones where the client speaks, and you listen.</b></span></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strengthening the Relationship from the First Meeting</span></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Run your first meeting in a positive atmosphere. Maintain a respectful, constructive tone throughout the conversation, and leave the door open for future collaboration. Even if the client chooses not to work with you, remember that every client is a potential ambassador who may recommend your services to others.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always document your meetings. Write down what went well, what challenges arose, which objections were raised, and what feedback you received. Reflect on whether your preparation was sufficient and accurate. This habit will help you improve continuously.</span></p>",

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In digital marketing, precise calculations often make the difference between mediocre and outstanding campaign results. One of the most important actions a business owner can take is targeting the right audience for their services. Targeting is essentially the process of identifying potential customers by segmenting audiences into groups based on changing parameters. Familiarity with a wide range of advertising strategies helps you adapt your campaigns to different target audiences and build long-lasting customer relationships.</span></p>",
    "<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional Customer Segmentation – Boosting E-Commerce Performance</span></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, customers openly admit that their buying decisions are heavily influenced by brands that use professional targeting and segmentation. That’s why it’s crucial to approach your audience fairly and make them feel you are speaking directly to them. Beyond basic demographics like location, gender, age, or interests, you can leverage advanced elements to identify potential customers. For example, to expand your audience, track social media groups relevant to your niche and build an ‘average customer profile’ from those groups. This allows you to bring exactly the right customers—those you can serve best—to your online store.</span></p>",
    "<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leveraging CRM for Customer Targeting</span></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your CRM system contains valuable insights about existing clients, which can be used to attract new ones. Within the system, you’ll find details such as company structure, products and services, competitor information, and even future plans. When searching for new clients, you can use this data to target the customers of competitors, create precise end-customer profiles, and deepen your campaign segmentation. This provides an excellent starting point for your first paid campaign.</span></p>",
    "<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer Targeting Strategies</span></h2>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To optimize your customer targeting process, follow these five strategies:</span></h3>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Define your ideal customer – Create a detailed persona of the customer most likely to buy your products. Outline their personality traits and demographics. Then, launch an ad campaign specifically tailored to this persona to test demand and refine your approach.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword analysis – Identify keywords relevant to your niche to align with trending searches. By knowing the most popular keywords, you can target audiences more effectively from the very beginning. Stay alert to keyword fluctuations and incorporate emerging terms into your campaigns. For example, in the service sector, seasonal phrases like “end-of-season sale” can be powerful triggers.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effective communication – Whenever your target audience shifts, your communication style must adapt as well. Effective communication means delivering clear, engaging messages through any channel. Match your tone, style, and even slang to your audience. This creates a shared language that fosters emotional connection and encourages interaction with your brand.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Target with tailored content – Just as communication matters, so does the content accompanying your messages. Use consistent branding, graphic design, and visual identity so that customers instantly recognize your brand. When you capture their attention quickly, you strengthen brand recognition and loyalty. With a clear customer profile in mind, it’s easier to pull them toward your brand through familiar, relatable content.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leverage influencers – One of the strongest trends in online marketing is influencer collaboration. This approach is particularly effective with younger audiences who value the opinions of online personalities. Partnering with an influencer who reaches your desired segment can instantly boost brand awareness. In some cases, working with several micro-influencers can be just as effective, offering more precise targeting. Influencer campaigns often generate fast, powerful responses that significantly improve conversion rates and sales.</span></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Ideal Target Audience = Paying Customers</span></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracking your target audience with reliable, professional tools helps you refine your campaigns and improve results. That’s why it’s worth investing resources and strategic thought before launching your first campaign. After evaluating campaign impact, adjust your targeting process to focus exposure more precisely. Remember: every click on your ad is a potential sale and an opportunity to increase profits. The ultimate goal is to focus exposure on the type of visitors most likely to become paying customers.</span></p>"

    "<ol>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business customization – Every business has its own workflows, services, and customer relationships. The most critical requirement from a CRM system is perfect alignment with your business model. For example, if much of your work happens at customer locations, you’ll need easy access to your calendar with mobile notifications. Cloud storage ensures 24/7 accessibility, making CRM a fully customized solution for your needs.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional implementation – To maximize the value of CRM, the system must be properly tailored and implemented.

A well-executed implementation provides upgrades and features that continuously support your daily operations.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organization and clarity – A successful business runs on structure. Whether it’s a clear dashboard or integration with project management tools, CRM gives you real-time insights into everything happening in your business. Decision-makers can rely on its clear, organized data to identify issues such as unpaid accounts or churned customers—and respond quickly.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24/7 availability – For managers striving to hit goals, availability is a game-changer. CRM systems based on cloud services allow you to access data anytime, anywhere—via desktop, laptop, or mobile. This ensures customers get the solutions they need even outside traditional business hours.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seamless teamwork – Growth often means hiring new staff. CRM makes onboarding easy by giving employees direct access to customer data. Even with staff turnover, the system ensures service continuity, as new employees can quickly get up to speed through documented client histories.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee management – Beyond customer relationships, CRM also helps you manage your team. Track productivity, working hours, performance metrics, and even customer satisfaction.

But focusing only on one element—like service—without innovating your product, can leave gaps that competitors will quickly notice and exploit.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s why businesses must continually raise the bar—ensuring not only excellent service but also competitive, updated offerings and ongoing customer engagement. Satisfaction is never static; it requires ongoing effort and adaptability.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>How to Set Customer Satisfaction Goals</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Satisfaction is subjective and depends heavily on customer expectations. To set realistic service goals, you first need to understand what your customers value most. Proactivity and openness are key—listening actively to customers provides valuable insights for setting your benchmarks.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conducting regular satisfaction surveys with different stakeholders—executives, managers, and end users—helps you get a complete picture. With these insights, you can establish measurable service standards and create structured procedures that consistently deliver positive experiences.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>Customer Satisfaction Starts with the Small Details</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving satisfaction begins with daily actions and interactions. By applying these four guiding principles, you can strengthen customer trust and deliver a superior experience right from the start:</span></p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A service-first mindset – Go beyond basic customer service. Enrich your professional knowledge, adapt your communication to customer expectations, and instill a culture of attentive, empathetic, and solution-oriented service across the business.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engagement at all levels – Build relationships not only with end users but also with decision-makers. Each level of the customer’s organization offers different perspectives, from strategic value to operational challenges.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anonymous feedback – Customers may hesitate to share dissatisfaction directly. Anonymous surveys or neutral feedback channels encourage honesty and uncover valuable insights that may otherwise go unspoken.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constructive response to feedback – Create a culture where feedback is welcomed and acted upon. Analyze responses, identify trends, and use them to implement meaningful improvements that strengthen customer relationships.</span></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<h2><b>Using CRM Data to Enhance Customer Satisfaction</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To consistently deliver excellent service, you need structure. A CRM system provides that structure by centralizing data, tracking interactions, and enabling you to compare past and present performance. From recording complaints to monitoring service quality, CRM becomes a powerful tool to quickly address issues and maintain high satisfaction levels.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every effort you make to improve customer satisfaction can be documented and analyzed within the CRM. Organized, accurate tracking is the foundation for customer service that truly meets expectations—and helps you adjust your products and services in response to real customer needs.</span></p>"

    "</ul>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing this process requires responsibility and out-of-the-box thinking. It’s important to make the transition easier for employees and create space for them to share concerns openly.</span></li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve already decided your business needs a CRM system. Implementation has begun, customer data has been imported, and login details are ready for every employee. You’re moments away from launch and excited to take the business to the next level.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what if employees don’t use the CRM regularly? Even after launch? If the system isn’t adopted, your investment won’t pay off—and you may find yourself back at square one, lacking tracking, monitoring, or advanced customer management capabilities. That’s why it’s critical to invest effort into making the CRM part of your employees’ daily routine.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>A CRM System Requires Ongoing Maintenance</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A CRM without data is like an office without desks or chairs—it simply can’t fulfill its purpose. You’ve already invested time and resources in selecting and implementing the system. A data-rich CRM enables smarter decision-making, clearer customer insights, and more effective service.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When past interactions and customer needs are recorded and clearly displayed, your team can reduce errors, improve communication, and deliver a higher level of professionalism. But this requires consistent, everyday data entry and updates.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>Eight Tactics to Build a CRM Routine</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure your CRM delivers results, it must be updated regularly. These eight strategies will help you and your team adopt the system successfully:</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Sell the Benefits, Not the Burdens</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like in sales, value is what convinces people. When introducing CRM to your team, focus on the advantages: new leads, clear customer overviews, and streamlined sales funnels that make their work easier. Sell the system’s value to win their buy-in.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Adapt CRM to Different Departments</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest strength of CRM is flexibility. Each department has unique needs—so involve team members in tailoring the system. Allow representatives from different areas to test the CRM and share feedback. This not only creates a system that fits your business but also builds internal champions who model effective usage.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Choose the Right CRM</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may sound obvious, but system selection matters. A good CRM should:</span></p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integrate with existing tools like email, file-sharing, or social media management.</span></b></li>",
    "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automatically log interactions to save time and reduce errors.</span></li>",
    "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scale with your business growth and adapt to different sales stages.</span></li>",
    "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide detailed analytics across multiple areas, including call quality, sales performance, and funnel effectiveness.</span></li>",
    "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be easy to navigate, ensuring employees can work comfortably for long hours.</span></li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing the right CRM upfront ensures long-term adoption and success.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Launch at the Right Time</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t disrupt employees’ busiest times. Roll out the CRM strategically—such as at the start of a new month, quarter, or fiscal year—when workloads are lighter, and teams are more open to change.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also aligns with onboarding new employees, giving the CRM a chance to become a natural part of everyday workflows from day one.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Provide Predefined Workflows</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t hand employees an empty system. Set up customer cards, sales stages, and reporting templates in advance. A structured system helps employees see the bigger picture, adapt faster, and generate useful reports right away.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Share Tips and Best Practices</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After initial feedback, review where employees struggle—such as data entry or managing customer files. Offer solutions at the company level and share quick tips or guides. Solving small challenges early prevents them from becoming barriers to adoption.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Lead by Example</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leadership sets the tone. If managers consistently use the CRM—sending updates through it, requesting reports only from it—employees will naturally follow. Over time, CRM use will become second nature across the organization.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Use Incentives to Drive Adoption</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set clear rules: “If it’s not in the CRM, it doesn’t exist.” Then encourage usage with positive incentives. Run internal competitions—for example, rewarding the employee who adds the most new customer records. Recognition and rewards create motivation while reinforcing good habits.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>Changing Habits the Right Way</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one enjoys changing their routine—but with the right approach, it becomes easier. Involve employees throughout the CRM adoption process, encourage open communication, and handle challenges responsibly. When employees feel engaged and supported, they’re far more likely to embrace new systems and workflows. Effective communication and proactive leadership are the keys to making CRM adoption a success.</span></p>"

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For every small business owner, it’s clear that customer relationships are the driving force behind success. That’s why the idea of implementing a CRM system—even in the early stages—can be highly relevant. A CRM enables you to define clear workflows and significantly improve customer service. But since CRM is also an investment, it’s natural to want reassurance that it will truly serve your business in the best way possible.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you decide if CRM is the right investment, let’s explore the main reasons why businesses need it.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>How Can a CRM System Help You?</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A CRM system has the power to take your business to the next level. By storing, analyzing, and managing customer and internal data, you can make better, more informed decisions. CRM also manages marketing efforts, expanding your customer base more effectively. Sales calls become more productive when the right data is clearly displayed, ultimately increasing conversion rates.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRM is a powerful tool tailored to your business needs, designed to scale as you grow. By centralizing everything in one workspace, it provides a clear overview of your operations, helping you understand your customers and your business more deeply—and achieve success with confidence.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>Seven Signs Your Business Needs a CRM</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re unsure whether CRM is necessary, here are seven common signs that highlight the need for it:</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. You Can’t Keep Up with Incoming Leads</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business is booming, and new leads are flowing in daily—but you’re struggling to respond effectively to each one. A professional CRM helps you assign tasks, prioritize leads, and ensure no opportunity slips through the cracks. As a result, your sales team can respond promptly, increasing both customer acquisition and revenue.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Customer Information Is Hard to Find</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paper notes, sticky reminders, or scattered files may work for a small customer base—but as you grow, this becomes unmanageable. CRM organizes all client data into structured profiles, making communication smoother, records accessible, and service more efficient and profitable.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. You Lack Visibility into Sales Activities</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales teams are key to business growth. Without proper tracking, you can’t see progress or plan strategically. A CRM lets you update customer information on the go, centralize reports, and even manage operations without wasting time on lengthy meetings.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Your Customer Service Falls Short</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winning new clients is hard enough—losing them to poor service is even worse. If customer service is spending too much time handling complaints instead of solving problems, CRM can help. It unifies customer data, speeds up response times, and makes onboarding new employees easier. You can also offer automated support, freeing your team to focus on what matters most.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. You Struggle with Key Client Relationships</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all customers are equal. Large, strategic clients require special attention—and failing to meet their expectations can harm your long-term growth. CRM reminds you of important milestones, meetings, and follow-ups, ensuring your top clients feel valued and engaged.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Reporting Takes Too Much Time</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re still generating reports manually, you’re wasting valuable resources. CRM automates data collection, filters insights, and delivers accurate, real-time reports. Instead of spending hours on spreadsheets, you can focus on making smarter business decisions.</span></p>",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. You’re Unsure About Your Growth Strategy</span></h3>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re uncertain about how to handle business expansion without overloading your team, CRM provides clarity. It helps scale your processes smoothly, ensuring productivity and service quality don’t drop as customer demand increases.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>Attention to Detail Helps You Choose the Right CRM</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amid the daily rush, it’s easy to miss critical details. Growth is exciting, but it must be managed wisely. A CRM system centralizes all essential information, helping you make rational, reliable, and high-quality decisions that serve both your customers and your business. With the right CRM, expansion becomes not just possible—but sustainable.</span></p>"

    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, many business owners struggle to adapt during implementation and don’t maximize the system’s potential. To help, we’ve created a practical guide with answers to common questions and tips for a successful rollout.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>Professional CRM Implementation Can Boost Performance</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you begin, it’s worth understanding why CRM is such a powerful driver of business results. In fact, 82% of top-performing sales companies report CRM as critical to their success. By documenting customer needs during calls and meetings, CRM helps you tailor the perfect product or service offer. Internally, it creates order and improves service quality, from product management to technical support.</span></p>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To achieve the best results, your CRM must be adapted to your organization’s unique needs. This adaptation process—known as “implementation”—requires a broader view of your business and long-term goals.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>What Is CRM Implementation?</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implementation involves working closely with a technical expert to map out workflows in detail. You’ll analyze the customer journey from the very first interaction to daily relationship management. Key questions include: “What goals do we want to achieve with CRM?” and “Which workflows can CRM improve, and how?” These answers are then translated into CRM features—for example, automated updates to keep customers informed about project progress, reducing the effort needed for routine communication.</span></p>",
    "<h2><b>Eight Tips for Successful CRM Implementation</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the transition smooth and effective, consider these eight proven strategies:</span></p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lead by Example – As a manager, commit to using CRM from the start. Enter tasks directly into the system during early rollout, and your employees will naturally follow your lead.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appoint a Project Manager – CRM implementation needs clear leadership. A dedicated project manager ensures the system meets business needs both strategically and operationally, even in small companies.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designate a “Power User” – This is the employee who masters every feature and shortcut in the system. They play a vital role in identifying improvements, solving issues, training staff, and liaising with technical support.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create Excitement – Change isn’t always easy. Generate enthusiasm by introducing CRM with a positive touch—send a team-wide announcement or even host a small launch event to build motivation.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set Clear Usage Standards – Define how tasks should be logged, which contacts must be recorded, and other essentials. Document these standards in a usage guide to ensure consistency and smooth onboarding for new employees.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide Training – Develop a structured onboarding plan. Allow employees enough time to learn, practice, and adapt, while ensuring they follow established processes before diving into advanced features.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think Strategically – CRM should reflect your broader business model and goals. Define objectives in advance, then align CRM workflows to support long-term growth and development.</span></li>",
    "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embrace Change Positively – Change can feel disruptive at first, but with the right mindset, it becomes an opportunity. View CRM not as an obstacle, but as a path to improved efficiency and better results.</span></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<h2><b>Implementation Requires Planning and Adaptation</b></h2>",
    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling out a CRM system is a process that requires research, planning, and patience.

    "<li>The 4 stages of a successful sales process.</li>",
    "<li>How to create consistent growth in sales.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p><strong>Effective selling begins with the right mindset. This guide will show you how to close deals faster using the Four-Stage Model.</strong></p>",
    "<p>As business owners and service providers, you must know how to sell—how to inspire action and help customers solve their problems through smart purchasing decisions.</p>",
    "<p>After reading this guide, you’ll understand the customer journey in a sales conversation and learn the right approach to lead the discussion with high energy and confidence.</p>",
    "<p><strong>The Right Sales Mindset:</strong></p>",
    "<p>The first key to success in sales is mindset. Even the most skilled salesperson with advanced techniques will fail if they give the customer the wrong impression—that they’re simply trying to sell.</p>",
    "<p>The foundation of every sale is understanding the customer’s problem, empathizing, and offering a solution. But equally important is understanding the role of the sales conversation itself and your position within it.</p>",
    "<p>So what does it mean to be a salesperson? Does it mean using tricks that “work” on the customer just to get their credit card? Absolutely not. That approach leads to burnout and poor results.</p>",
    "<p><strong>What Is a Salesperson, Really?</strong></p>",
    "<p>The true definition of sales is moving the person in front of you to take action and improve at least one aspect of their life. So why use techniques and scripts? Because even when a customer knows they have a problem, they don’t always act on it. Often they don’t fully understand the value of your solution or how it could improve their life. That’s your job—to guide them with the right questions and empower them to resolve the issue themselves.</p>",
    "<p>The clearest sign of a successful sales process is when the customer thanks you afterward—grateful that your structured conversation helped them solve a problem they might not have resolved on their own.</p>",
    "<p>Now that you understand the right approach, let’s break down the four stages of a sales conversation and how to handle each effectively.</p>",
    "<p><strong>The Stages of a Sales Conversation:</strong></p>",
    "<p>There are four stages in the sales process. Together, they help you understand the customer, uncover their pains, present your solution, and close the deal.</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li><strong>The Rapport Stage</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>This happens at the very beginning of the conversation—whether it’s a meeting or a phone call. Here, you build a personal connection. It’s very difficult to sell to someone who doesn’t know you, doesn’t trust you, or doubts your ability to solve their problem.</p>",
    "<p>By engaging in small talk, the customer gets to know your personality outside of sales, making it easier to guide them later with confidence.</p>",
    "<p>This stage also lowers the natural tension that comes with sales conversations, creating a friendlier and more open atmosphere.</p>",
    "<p><strong>How do you do it?</strong></p>",
    "<p>Ask simple questions: Where are you from? What do you do for work? Find a thread and expand it—whether it’s their hometown, job, or hobby. If you discover something in common, even better.</p>",
    "<p>Once you feel comfortable and have built rapport, move to the next stage: Discovery.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"2\">",
    "<li><strong>The Discovery Stage</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>This is where you dig into the customer’s problem. Regardless of your role—whether you provide services, products, or solutions—your goal is to uncover pain points, not just talk about surface-level details.</p>",
    "<p>For example, imagine a technician selling water heater services. Instead of simply asking, “Do you need a repair or a new unit?”, they should explore the problem: The heater hasn’t worked for two days, there’s no hot water, the family has been boiling water to shower—it’s frustrating and unsustainable. That conversation shows empathy and real understanding of the customer’s struggle.</p>",
    "<p>The more precise your questions, the more effectively you hit the customer’s pain points. If you handle many sales conversations, prepare a list of common customer pains and tailor it for each call.</p>",
    "<p>Once discovery is complete, you move to the Direction stage.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"3\">",
    "<li><strong>The Direction Stage</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Here, you present your product or service as the solution to the customer’s specific problems.</p>",
    "<p>For instance, if the customer complained about recurring breakdowns with their old water heater, you position your solution as one that eliminates exactly that issue. This makes your offer clearly superior and builds trust that you’ve understood their needs precisely.</p>",
    "<p>Authenticity is key here. If the customer senses you’re just trying to sell, they’ll become more defensive, making it much harder to close.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"4\">",
    "<li><strong>The Closing Stage</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>This is where you need high energy to move the customer out of their comfort zone and into action. As mentioned earlier, sales is about inspiring someone to act once you’ve uncovered their pain points.</p>",
    "<p>Summarize the customer’s challenges and position your product as the clear solution. If your process has effectively addressed their pain points, closing should feel natural. Still, you may need techniques to prevent hesitation or backtracking.</p>",
    "<p>One technique is to delay asking for payment details until after confirming the decision. For example, take down basic information first, then request payment details at the very end.</p>",
    "<p>If your process involves a preliminary meeting, like preparing a project brief, closing is even easier. Simply ask: “When would be best to meet and prepare the brief—tomorrow morning or later in the afternoon?” Once the customer commits to a time, the deal is essentially closed.</p>",
    "<p>Payment can then be finalized during or after that meeting.</p>",
    "<p><strong>In Summary</strong></p>",
    "<p>An effective sales process starts with your mindset. Remember, it’s not about “getting one over” on the customer—it’s about guiding them to solve their own problems.</p>",
    "<p>The four stages help you do just that: build rapport, ask the right questions to uncover pain, position your solution as the answer, and close with confidence.</p>",

    "<li>Get to know the tools inside CRM platforms.</li>",
    "<li>Practical tips for using them effectively.</li>",
    "<li>How these tools can transform your business.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p><strong>If CRM systems still feel like a tough code to crack, this guide is for you. We’ll walk you through the platform, its tools, hidden tricks, and how it can organize and streamline your business.</strong></p>",
    "<p>If your business still doesn’t have a CRM system, it’s worth considering one seriously. Many businesses report a huge transformation once they made the switch.</p>",
    "<p>Maybe you’re overwhelmed by all the features and tools such a system offers. If so, this guide will finally give you the clarity you need.</p>",
    "<p>By the end, you’ll know exactly which tools you’ll encounter, how to use them, and how to get the most out of them for your business. Let’s dive in.</p>",
    "<p><strong>What Are the 3 Core Areas of CRM Software?</strong></p>",
    "<p>Most CRM platforms are built around three core areas:</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li><strong>Operational CRM.</strong> This covers the human side of your relationship with customers—everything from personal details like birthdays to maintaining ongoing engagement for loyalty and retention.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Analytical CRM.</strong> This focuses on data and metrics: tracking performance, monitoring customer behaviors, measuring conversions, and spotting areas for improvement. From the number of closed deals to returns, these insights help you plan your next moves strategically.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Collaborative CRM.</strong> This area ensures smooth workflows across your team. It includes process automation, instant messaging, and file sharing for efficient collaboration.</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>These are the three pillars you’ll find in every CRM platform. Of course, most systems also include additional features such as marketing tools or custom modules tailored to your business needs.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Key CRM Tools in Detail:</strong></p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li><strong>Customer Management.</strong> Store and analyze customer data for better decision-making. Details can include demographics, purchase history, past promotions, satisfaction levels, and more. Sales teams use this data to close deals, while marketers use it to segment audiences and run targeted campaigns.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Customer Journey Mapping.</strong> Track the full path from the first touchpoint to purchase. See where customers meet your brand, how long the process takes, and adjust your marketing accordingly.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Sales Forecasting.</strong> Generate reports predicting future sales based on leads, past clients, and defined campaigns.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Email & Messaging Integration.</strong> Communicate directly with customers, employees, and suppliers without leaving the system. Internal instant messaging keeps everyone aligned in real time.</li>",
    "<li><strong>File & Content Sharing.</strong> Centralize marketing assets, supplier materials, and other content in one place so your team can collaborate seamlessly.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Data Analysis.</strong> Dive deep into performance metrics, from marketing ROI to sales conversions, and use the insights to improve decision-making.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Promotions Tracking.</strong> Monitor ongoing promotions, measure results, and identify what works best for maximizing profit margins.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Company Contacts.</strong> Manage suppliers, consultants, and internal contacts in one organized hub. Track key performance results for external partners as well.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Lead Management.</strong> Capture, qualify, and track incoming leads, including their source and actions required for follow-up.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Marketing Campaign Tracking.</strong> Manage campaigns, measure conversion rates, and compare performance across different initiatives.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Customer Segmentation Tags.</strong> Categorize customers by purchase frequency, product type, loyalty, or satisfaction level to identify your most valuable clients and focus retention efforts where it matters.</li>",
    "<li><strong>External Analytics Integration.</strong> Connect tools like Google Analytics to track SEO, blog views, and other digital marketing KPIs directly inside your CRM.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Support Department Integration.</strong> Monitor customer service interactions, measure resolution quality, and build procedures to ensure better satisfaction and retention.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Ongoing Activity Tracking.</strong> Stay on top of employee activity, inventory, payments, and supplier updates in real time.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Order Management.</strong> Manage customer orders and provide updates on their status—keeping everything transparent and organized.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Mobile Access.</strong> CRM platforms support mobile use, so you and your team can update and receive notifications on the go.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Social Media Integration.</strong> Track and analyze social media channels separately from other marketing efforts for clearer insights.</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>To sum up: CRM systems evolve year by year, offering everything a business needs to run efficiently. It may take time to adjust, but the payoff is huge—saving time, increasing growth, and creating standardized workflows across every department.</p>",
    "<p>We hope this guide gave you a clear overview of CRM system features and how they can support your business success.</p>"

    "<li>How to choose a CRM system for your small business.</li>",
    "<li>What you can achieve with the right platform.</li>",
    "<li>Key data and insights on the challenges of CRM adoption in small businesses.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p><strong>When your small business is drowning in data, losing leads, and running messy marketing processes, the solution is a CRM system that brings order to your workflow, your cash flow, and your business. But how do you choose the right one? Here’s our complete guide.</strong></p>",
    "<p>Missed leads or poor customer service are only some of the signs that it’s time to level up with a CRM system. A good platform helps you streamline operations, refresh outdated workflows, and inject efficiency into your sales and marketing. The result? Hitting your goals faster with clarity and structure.</p>",
    "<p>Let’s start from the basics.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Does your business actually need a CRM?</strong></p>",
    "<p>There’s no doubt: CRM systems have helped businesses grow faster, spot critical mistakes, and become more effective. But not every business is ready for one—and the wrong choice can lead to wasted time, money, and frustration.</p>",
    "<p>The test is simple: Do you already have structured sales processes? Is your marketing strategy consistent, stable, and delivering results? If you’re still experimenting—searching for the right marketing channel or the perfect sales script—you’re probably not there yet.</p>",
    "<p>A CRM is designed for businesses that already have clear processes in sales, marketing, and customer management. With that foundation in place, technology can elevate operations to the next level. But if you’re still figuring out how to market and sell your product, your focus should be on understanding your audience, building funnels, and establishing a sales process before bringing in a complex (and often costly) system.</p>",
    "<p><strong>The Next Step: Creating a CRM Requirement Sheet</strong></p>",
    "<p>If you’ve answered yes—your foundation is solid, you know what you sell, who you sell to, and how you market—then it’s time to implement this essential tool.</p>",
    "<p>But before you dive into Google searches and get bombarded with ads, you need one thing: a CRM requirements sheet.</p>",
    "<p>This document should cover two key areas: 1) your business needs and 2) your business goals. Tackling both gives you clarity and helps you even test-drive a free CRM trial to see what fits best.</p>",
    "<p><strong>The Key Questions:</strong></p>",
    "<p>Start with your <strong>business goals</strong>, as these are the most critical.</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li>How many sales do you close each month, and what’s your growth target?</li>",
    "<li>How long does it take to close a deal, and what’s your goal for shortening that cycle?</li>",
    "<li>On a scale of 1–10, how satisfied are your customers today, and what’s your improvement target?</li>",
    "<li>Do you see new trends in your niche? How can you leverage them?</li>",
    "<li>What’s your current marketing ROI (investment vs. revenue)? What’s your improvement goal, and how will you get there?</li>",
    "<li>What does your marketing process look like today? Can it be streamlined? What’s your goal for improvement?</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Answering these questions gives you a clear picture of both short- and long-term goals. Now you just need the right tool to help you organize data and achieve them.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Step Two: Evaluating the System Itself</strong></p>",
    "<p>Here we look at the platform—its functions, pricing, and usability.</p>",
    "<p>In principle, your CRM should support all your business objectives: marketing, sales, customer retention, task management, and more. But the more features a system has, the more complex and expensive it becomes. So you’ll want to consider additional factors:</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li>What marketing tracking tools are available? Are they sufficient for your goals?</li>",
    "<li>What sales tracking tools are available? Do they meet your needs?</li>",
    "<li>What customer management tools are available? Are they enough for great service and repeat sales?</li>",
    "<li>As your business grows, will the CRM scale with you? At what cost?</li>",
    "<li>What’s the monthly subscription fee? Is it sustainable?</li>",
    "<li>On a scale of 1–10, how easy is the platform to use?</li>",
    "<li>If you have staff, how much training will be required? Do you have the resources?</li>",
    "<li>Does the vendor provide training and support? This can greatly shorten the adoption curve.</li>",
    "<li>Does it include mobile access?</li>",
    "<li>What level of security does the provider offer?</li>",
    "<li>Can it generate invoices and quotes?</li>",
    "<li>Does it include project management and time tracking tools?</li>",
    "<li>If you switch systems later, can your data be migrated easily?</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Creating a detailed requirements sheet takes time, but it ensures you’ll choose the best system for your business needs and goals.</p>",
    "<p>Once you have this sheet, we recommend testing free tools first (make sure they include marketing automation and customer management). You may find that a free solution is enough for now.</p>",
    "<p>Next, let’s look at real-world challenges other businesses have faced when adopting CRM systems—and how you can avoid them.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Lessons from Experience – Data from Other Businesses</strong></p>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li><strong>17%</strong> said their biggest challenge was proper use and adoption by employees and sales teams.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li><strong>31%</strong> reported the main issue was cost—maintaining a system robust enough to support future needs.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li><strong>20%</strong> cited poor vendor support as their main challenge—highlighting the importance of checking support options before signing a contract.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p>If you’ve made it this far—congratulations. It means you’re ready to invest what it takes to reach your business goals with a CRM system tailored to your needs.</p>",
    "<p>To recap: the role of CRM is to transform the way your business operates by organizing information and analyzing data to show what works, what doesn’t, and where to improve.</p>",
    "<p>It will help you upgrade your marketing, sales processes, time management, customer service, and retention efforts.</p>",
    "<p>The right time to implement CRM is when you already have clear processes in place and need efficiency and structure to scale.</p>",
    "<p>The decision should follow two steps:</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li>Define your business goals and the tools required to achieve them.</li>",
    "<li>Specify your current needs and evaluate available systems accordingly.</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Follow these steps, and your choice will be smarter—and your business stronger.</p>",
    "<p>We hope this guide helps you define what you need, how to outline your requirements, and how to approach the right CRM decision for your business.</p>",
    "<p>Good luck!</p>"

      "content": [
    "<ul>",
    "<li>How to create content that boosts conversion rates within your funnel.</li>",
    "<li>How to build a funnel that drives sales growth.</li>",
    "<li>Understanding customer needs and pain points.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p><strong>The success of your marketing funnel depends largely on your content and the strategy behind it. So how do you craft content that truly connects? This guide has all the answers.</strong></p>",
    "<p>Almost every business uses a marketing funnel. Yet, getting real results has become harder every day. The reason? Weak messaging and poorly targeted content. Let’s fix that—step by step.</p>",
    "<p><strong>What is a Marketing Funnel and Why Does Every Business Need One?</strong></p>",
    "<p>A marketing funnel helps you consistently bring in new customers.</p>",
    "<p>Here’s how it works:</p>",
    "<p>The funnel has three stages: Awareness, Nurture, and Conversion. Each stage moves prospects closer to making a purchase.</p>",
    "<p>That’s why every business needs an always-active funnel. Once you build one or two campaigns, you’ll see how powerful they can be for growth. Plus, guiding customers through the right process makes buying much easier for them.</p>",
    "<p>Your funnel’s success (or failure) depends on how well you optimize each step. That’s exactly what this guide will teach you—how to create a funnel that delivers while competitors struggle to break even.</p>",
    "<p><strong>How Do You Build an Effective Funnel?</strong></p>",
    "<p>Start with this question: How does today’s customer react when exposed to an ad, an email, or any marketing message? The answer: they’re usually passive, even skeptical.</p>",
    "<p>Modern buyers have advanced filters that block out anything that feels like ‘just another marketer.’ The challenge? These filters are ruthless—and they often block out good messages too.</p>",
    "<p><strong>The Solution?</strong></p>",
    "<p>Create content that hits the right emotional triggers. While tools and trends evolve, people don’t change: their desires, fears, dreams, and emotions are constant. The real challenge is cutting through the noise and making your message resonate on a human level.</p>",
    "<p>At the heart of your funnel, make sure you lead prospects through a unique emotional journey—one they haven’t experienced before. Show them you understand their struggles and feelings better than anyone else.</p>",
    "<p>That’s what will make your content stand out, build trust, and ultimately turn them into paying customers.</p>",
    "<p><strong>The Funnel Stages and Key Focus Points</strong></p>",
    "<p>The funnel has three main stages:</p>",
    "<p><strong>Stage 1: Awareness (Exposure)</strong></p>",
    "<p>Here, your goal is to grab attention and draw people in. But don’t try to look ‘cool’ or rely on clichés—they won’t work. Instead, show real aspects of your business that resonate with the right audience.</p>",
    "<p>For example, if you target committed business owners, create content that highlights dedication, involvement, and passion for growth. This attracts people with shared values—and those are the customers you want.</p>",
    "<p>Your content should also spark strong emotions like surprise, urgency, or relief. But remember: be specific. Generic emotions or overused dreams won’t cut through the noise.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Stage 2: Delivering Value</strong></p>",
    "<p>At this stage, your mission is to build trust and authority. Your content should make prospects feel:</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li>You understand them better than anyone else — <em>empathy</em>.</li>",
    "<li>You’re an expert who can get them where they want to be — <em>credibility</em>.</li>",
    "<li>You’re here to create a win–win: solve their problem while building a long-term relationship — <em>transparency</em>.</li>",
    "<li>You trigger the right emotions that inspire them to take action — <em>motivation</em>.</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Think of each of these as a scale from 0–10. The higher you score across all four, the closer you are to turning prospects into customers.</p>",
    "<p>Practically, this means planning a content calendar where each piece of content aligns with one of these four elements. For example, in the ‘empathy’ category, share stories about challenges you and your audience face daily.</p>",
    "<p>Of course, to do this well, you need deep knowledge of your customer—ideally as well as you know yourself.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Stage 3: Conversion (Call-to-Action & Closing)</strong></p>",
    "<p>If you’ve done the first two stages right, closing the sale won’t be difficult. Still, sometimes prospects need an extra push at the right moment. This is where closing techniques come in—like offering a free consultation where you naturally present your solution, or sending personalized questions followed by a strategy call.</p>",
    "<p>There are countless techniques, but remember: the strength of your first two stages will largely determine your closing rate.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>",
    "<p>We hope this guide helps you design smarter funnels, craft content that resonates, and bring in more customers faster.</p>"

    "<ul>",
    "<li>The essential steps before building a sales process that actually drives business growth.</li>",
    "<li>How to evaluate your offer and the key conditions for successful sales.</li>",
    "<li>Proven methods to increase your conversion rates by dozens of percentage points.</li>",

    "<p>",
    "<strong>If you’ve learned how to sell, practiced the methods, yet still struggle to close deals, it’s likely you’re missing a few critical steps beforehand. Here are the actions you need to take to make every sale easier.</strong>",
    "</p>",
    "<p>Many business owners who have completed sales training still find selling difficult—especially with high-ticket offers. Is the issue poor selling skills? Not necessarily. Often, it’s because the offer itself and the surrounding details haven’t been structured in a way that allows the product to practically sell itself.</p>",
    "<p>This guide will walk you step by step through the different elements that influence the sales process and show you what makes the difference between success and failure. With these adjustments, selling will feel far more natural—and even enjoyable.</p>",
    "<p>",
    "<strong>Why aren’t you closing sales yet?</strong>",
    "</p>",
    "<p>It’s the obvious question—and one you’ve probably asked yourself. The simple answer is to review whether you’re executing your sales process correctly. But in many cases, the real issue begins long before the sales call: with the product, the way you position it, and who you target.</p>",
    "<p>In the following sections, you’ll learn practical steps to refine your offer so the sales process feels smooth and effective.</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li><strong>Match the product to your target audience.</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>One of the biggest obstacles in sales is offering a product in a way that doesn’t truly resonate. A smart sales offer must fit your ideal customer like a glove.</p>",
    "<p>The key is to stop viewing your product as just an item or service, and instead frame it as the solution to a pressing problem.</p>",
    "<p>For example, in the personal training industry: you could sell hourly sessions, but that’s not what clients really want. They don’t care about an hour with you—they want a toned body, improved health, and visible results. So instead of selling ‘training hours,’ sell a transformation program that takes them from point A (overweight, unhappy) to point B (fit, confident). Clients will happily pay more for a solution than for isolated sessions.</p>",
    "<p>Once you recognize that you’re not selling time, but rather results, the next step is to define your target audience clearly. Who do you want to help? What are their beliefs, age groups, lifestyles? Build a customer persona and craft a tailored solution that speaks directly to them.</p>",
    "<p>The result: when you meet a client and present a solution that perfectly addresses their needs, the sale feels natural—they can clearly see how they move from their current problem to the desired outcome.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"2\">",
    "<li><strong>Understand your client’s budget.</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Even after defining your target audience, one key factor remains: affordability. If you’ve heard ‘It’s too expensive’ in sales calls, sometimes it’s just an objection, but often it’s a reality. Your solution, at your price point, needs to align with the financial capacity of your audience.</p>",
    "<p>For instance, offering a $15,000 personal training package to someone struggling to make rent simply isn’t viable. That doesn’t mean your pricing is wrong, but your audience must be matched to it.</p>",
    "<p>Once you’ve defined your target audience, make sure their lifestyle and budget allow them to invest in your solution.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"3\">",
    "<li><strong>Why should they choose you?</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Even with the right product and price, one crucial question remains in every buyer’s mind: Why you?</p>",
    "<p>Every business talks about ‘differentiation,’ yet many still lack a true answer. This shows up in sales calls and in the energy business owners convey about their products. If you’re not fully convinced your offer is the best solution, your prospect won’t be either.</p>",
    "<p>Every business has a unique strength, whether or not they realize it. To uncover yours, list your personal and professional strengths, then connect them directly to your product or service. That’s your true differentiator.</p>",
    "<p>The people who value those strengths will become your best clients. To test it, present your offer highlighting your differentiator to potential customers or friends. Ask if it resonates. Refine until you find the message that clicks deeply with your audience.</p>",
    "<p>Once you truly understand your differentiator, your confidence will show. You’ll speak with conviction, and your product will naturally position itself as the best solution.</p>",
    "<p><strong>In summary:</strong> These three steps will help you build an offer that’s tailored to your audience, easier to sell, and provides real solutions for your clients. Step one is to design a product that solves a precise problem. Step two is to make sure your audience can afford it. Step three is to clearly communicate why you are the best choice.</p>",
    "<p>Apply these steps consistently, and the sales process will become much smoother—and you’ll close more clients with ease.</p>"

    "</ul>",
    "<p>",
    "<strong>For many business challenges—in sales, marketing, and products—there is often one solution: knowing the people who are, by chance but not really by chance, your customers. This is the guide to building a smarter business.</strong>",
    "</p>",
    "<p>Many messages reach business owners, but for some reason they are not applied in their businesses. When a problem arises, they look for a quick fix, but often the issue is deeper. Building a customer profile is the best example of a basic element missing from many businesses that face challenges but don’t understand why.</p>",
    "<p>This is an ongoing process, a continuous collection of information, but the more it progresses, the more your business will grow accordingly. After reading this guide, you will know the exact steps to make your business smarter.</p>",
    "<p><strong>What is a customer profile?</strong></p>",
    "<p>A customer profile is a document that describes everything we know about the customer: demographics, preferences, emotions, pains, experiences. The more information we have, the deeper our understanding of the customers.</p>",
    "<p>The technical data in the profile is not just to know where the customer lives or what they do for a living. All of these points lead to the next goal—building a precise psychological profile that includes the customer’s pains, fears, and hopes. This personal understanding is what makes the difference between smart marketing and generic marketing that doesn’t bring the desired results.</p>",
    "<p>As we will see later, the correct order is to start with the basics—occupation, age, gender, place of residence, income level—and then move deeper into the customer’s personality itself.</p>",
    "<p>What’s important to remember is that understanding customers is a continuous process: constantly asking them questions, getting to know them better, identifying new target audiences, and redefining them.</p>",
    "<p>But before all that—why does it matter, and what can it do for your business? Let’s see.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Why do we even need all the customer’s details?</strong></p>",
    "<p>Every business has a few basic foundations that help it move toward its financial goals. An accurate profile serves the business in all of these foundations—product, marketing, and sales.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Product:</strong></p>",
    "<p>When you know who your customer is and what they prefer, you immediately understand which products they need, what will suit them more, and what less. This allows you to develop and adapt the product to your customer’s needs.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Marketing:</strong></p>",
    "<p>If we assume that smart marketing means speaking the customer’s language and addressing their exact pains, then without building a profile your marketing will speak to everyone or no one, which obviously affects results. Knowing your customers is critical to effective marketing that delivers success.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Sales:</strong></p>",
    "<p>There are many parallels between marketing and sales. That’s why effective sales start with knowing the potential customer. Only by understanding them can you ask the right questions that lead them to the pain points you already know and wait for them to surface themselves.</p>",
    "<p>Improvement in these three foundations will drive rapid business growth—depending on how flexible you are with customer knowledge and ongoing profile adjustments.</p>",
    "<p><strong>So how do we get to know the customer? Based on what?</strong></p>",
    "<p>Many business owners understand they need to know their customers, but don’t know how. How are they supposed to guess where the customer lives, their age, hobbies? Where do you find this information? Hack into the national database? Of course not.</p>",
    "<p>Every detail you write reflects a lifestyle and personality. That’s what really matters—understanding the <strong>customer’s personality</strong>.</p>",
    "<p>Of course, the best way is to know the customer directly—talk to them, build a relationship, and based on the knowledge you collect, build the profile. With today’s technologies, you can also gather plenty of data about each customer, allowing you to create a fact-based profile instead of guesses.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Here’s an example to illustrate.</strong></p>",
    "<p>Rami owns a sportswear and fitness store. He wants to understand his target audience for the new Nike shoe model. (It’s important to focus on a specific product, not something general.)</p>",
    "<p>Who would buy this new model?</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li>People looking for a sports shoe for the gym.</li>",
    "<li>People who are ‘obsessed’ with the Nike brand and buy every new product.</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Now, for each point we’ll define demographics. Is this shoe for men or women? What age range are those ‘obsessed’ with Nike—probably younger, right? Define age range. Where do they live? What do they do? What is their financial status?</p>",
    "<p>We’ll look for the unique features of the product and the traits of those who are likely to buy it.</p>",
    "<p>The more questions and data you collect, the more you’ll move from broad common denominators to narrow and personal ones. This is true familiarity with your target audience.</p>",
    "<p>Important note: the data you write won’t necessarily be fully accurate, but based on probability and product characteristics, it will lead you to understand the target segment that matters.</p>",
    "<p><strong>How do you build a customer profile?</strong></p>",
    "<p>First, focus on the business’s general data. What market are you in? Name the market. What share of the surrounding population needs these products/services? What are the market’s characteristics—leisure, education, business, consumer basics, etc.?</p>",
    "<p>After identifying the market, move on to the customer. If you have a clear picture of your product, its benefits, and why it’s better than competitors, the work becomes much easier.</p>",
    "<p>Now let’s talk about your customer. There are a few groups of questions you need to prepare to reach the bottom line: Who am I selling to? Who am I marketing to? What problem does my product solve?</p>",
    "<p><strong>First group of questions – Demographics.</strong></p>",
    "<p>This group includes demographic questions: age, gender, workplace, field of work, and anything else you can think of. The more the better. There are detailed profile templates with hundreds of questions, so no need to list them all here.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Second group of questions – Opinions and social affiliation.</strong></p>",
    "<p>Here we want to understand the customer themselves and the group they belong to. Try to see how they would react to certain opinions. This is a key personality indicator for your research.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Third group of questions – Emotions, fears, hopes.</strong></p>",
    "<p>Now you really need to wear the psychologist’s hat for a bit, but don’t worry—it’s an interesting process. After the first two steps, you’ll have plenty of knowledge about your ideal customer. Soon you’ll even be able to greet them personally.</p>",
    "<p>At this stage, ask: What dominant traits do you see in your customer? There may be several types of customers, each group sharing some traits. What path has life taken them on? What are they afraid of? What’s their biggest desire? What do they hope for? What weaknesses are they hiding?</p>",
    "<p><strong>Final step – Defining products, sales, and marketing messages.</strong></p>",
    "<p>You’re almost done. After understanding your audience’s pains, fears, and hopes, it’s time to adjust your sales scripts, products, and marketing messages to match the customer avatar you’ve built.</p>",
    "<p>In conclusion, we are confident that a deep definition of your customer profile will make your business smarter—one that sells itself, its products, and builds a loyal community of customers.</p>"

    "<li>The right way to retain customers and get each one to buy more from your business.</li>",
    "<li>Encouraging your customers to purchase from you again and again.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p><strong>Customer retention will reduce your marketing expenses, grow your brand, and increase revenue. But how do you actually achieve it? Here’s the complete guide to customer retention.</strong></p>",
    "<p>When you run a smart business, every action is intentional and proves itself in your bank account. Customer retention is an essential area for any business that wants to be effective. As an investment channel, it’s one of the fastest and most cost-efficient ways to grow.</p>",
    "<p>In this guide, you’ll learn how to create the systems and procedures for customer retention. After reading, you’ll be able to build an action plan and start managing your customers differently—gaining a loyal community and repeat purchases on a regular basis.</p>",
    "<p><strong>What is customer retention and what will your business gain from it?</strong></p>",
    "<p>Customer retention is your ability to develop long-term relationships with your customers so they choose you over competitors again and again. Most of us have bought a product that we already know we’ll purchase again from the same company once it wears out.</p>",
    "<p>So what makes a company’s product something you buy repeatedly? A great question.</p>",
    "<p>But before answering, it’s important to understand the direct and indirect benefits you gain by investing in customer retention.</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li><strong>Marketing expenses and ROI (Return on Investment):</strong> When you know how to retain customers who have already bought from you, every marketing expense produces a higher return. For example, if a campaign conversion rate is 20%, and you know 5% will join your loyal customer base through the system you’ve built, your campaign becomes far more profitable.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Brand:</strong> Customer retention plays a key role in brand building and community creation. Customers who buy repeatedly strengthen the perception that your products provide unique value that competitors don’t offer.</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p><strong>How do you build an effective customer retention system?</strong></p>",
    "<p>To build such a system, you need precise infrastructure based on customer understanding.</p>",
    "<p>Studies show that 70% of the buying experience is based on how the customer feels about how their issue is handled. This is why focusing on a pleasant purchase experience for each customer is critical—but it doesn’t stop there.</p>",
    "<p>To retain customers, you’ll need to collect data from them, map your products, and act accordingly.</p>",
    "<p><strong>The steps:</strong></p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li><strong>Regular customer feedback.</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Your retention procedures will be defined after analyzing trends from questionnaires you send to customers.</p>",
    "<p>The questionnaire should include questions about the product itself, user experience, customer service experience, and customer suggestions for improvement.</p>",
    "<p>Examples of customer feedback questions:</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li>Was your purchase experience convenient and positive? (Yes/No)</li>",
    "<li>If yes, what score would you give our sales process on a scale of 1–10?</li>",
    "<li>On a scale of 1–10, how well did the product meet your needs?</li>",
    "<li>Please elaborate in writing.</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>These four questions are a representative sample of how to phrase feedback to provide the best insights about customer tendencies, preferences, and satisfaction levels.</p>",
    "<p>Based on this information, you can create smart procedures that enhance the customer experience from the sales process through to receiving the product or service.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"2\">",
    "<li><strong>Understanding product usage and support.</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>The second step is to understand how customers use your product and provide the right support. For example, if users require guidance at the beginning, you should provide support representatives to help them get the most out of the product. This should be based on insights from your customer feedback reports.</p>",
    "<p>Full product support significantly upgrades the customer experience and shows that reliability and service come first in your business.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"3\">",
    "<li><strong>Regular customer communication.</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>A calendar showing when you last spoke with a customer helps you reach out at the right times and stay relevant. To maintain meaningful relationships, it’s important to see customers as more than just product users.</p>",
    "<p>These three steps are the foundation of your system. They show you which parts of your product need reinforcement, what kind of experience you want to deliver, and more.</p>",
    "<p>Still, to fully build your system, you’ll need tools that help you maintain effective communication with customers.</p>",
    "<p><strong>3 Ways to Retain Customers:</strong></p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li><strong>Reward loyal customers.</strong> Smart retention starts with your core customer base and expands from there. To empower loyal customers, you can offer benefits for repeat purchases or create a customer club. These simple actions make the next purchase much more appealing than competitors’ offers.</li>",
    "<li><strong>A plan for dissatisfied customers.</strong> Every business has unhappy customers. No product can fit 100% of the population, even when it seems universal.</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>To avoid harming retention efforts, prepare a clear plan for handling dissatisfaction. The smart approach is to take full responsibility—even if the issue isn’t your fault. Offer refunds or compensation, and decide whether to part ways with or retain the customer depending on the case.</p>",
    "<p>Keep this in mind: 96% of customers say they would purchase again from a company—even after a bad experience—if the company compensates them properly.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"3\">",
    "<li><strong>Adding value to the product.</strong> One of the most effective ways to retain customers is by building a community around your product. When buyers join a community they enjoy being part of, they will continue purchasing—even when the product itself is less relevant. A well-built community is one of the strongest tools for retention.</li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>For example, many global companies started with a single product but quickly realized their product created conversation and engagement. They formalized communities with meetups and inspiring content, keeping customers engaged and attracting new ones consistently.</p>",
    "<p>There are many more tools you can use for retention, but the key is that your procedures should be based on verified customer insights.</p>",
    "<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong> Customer retention is not optional—it’s a must for any smart business. The process begins with deep research into the customer experience and continues with adapting procedures to customer needs and continuously improving your product.</p>",
    "<p>Along the way, you’ll create a plan for handling complaints, build a community as added value, and reward your loyal customer base.</p>",
    "<p>We hope this guide has helped you understand the importance of customer retention and how to do it the right way.</p>"

    "<ul>",
    "<li>Build your customer service department and create procedures that serve your company’s goals.</li>",
    "<li>How to design customer service that drives business growth.</li>",
    "<li>A complete guide to smart procedures in your customer service department.</li>",
    "</ul>",
    "<p><strong>Everything you need to know about customer service that takes your business to the next level.</strong></p>",
    "<p>Like every department in a business, customer service requires clear procedures. Even more importantly, those procedures should align with and support the work of other departments. When done right, customer service becomes one of the core elements in building and advancing a stable, thriving business.</p>",
    "<p>By the end of this guide, you’ll know how to create effective customer service processes that help your business reach its goals faster.</p>",
    "<p><strong>The role of customer service in your business:</strong></p>",
    "<p>If we asked you what the customer service department is for, most people would answer: to serve the customers. That’s true—but it’s not the whole picture. On a basic level, the department provides product information, solves problems, and assists customers. But strategically, its purpose is much broader: shaping the customer experience, strengthening retention, and delivering on your brand values through excellent service.</p>",
    "<p>And like any other effective business function, customer service requires clear goals, progress tracking, and continuous improvement to make sure it supports the company’s overall objectives.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Here are some supporting stats:</strong></p>",
    "<p>In a survey on customer service and customer experience, 90% of respondents said they stopped buying from a company that ignored their request without even trying to help. That tells us customer service needs to be proactive, not passive. Another 86% said they cut ties after a single poor service experience.</p>",
    "<p>Even more striking: an unhappy customer tells an average of 21 people about their bad experience, while a satisfied customer tells only 8.</p>",
    "<p>On the flip side, excellent customer service is a huge opportunity. Because many companies still treat it as secondary, those that invest in smarter, customer-focused service stand out and win loyalty.</p>",
    "<p>So how do you build such a department, and which processes should you implement? Let’s break it down.</p>",
    "<p><strong>How to build a customer service team that solves problems quickly:</strong></p>",
    "<p>If your customer service doesn’t deliver solutions with 1) speed, 2) simplicity, and 3) courtesy and understanding—you’re failing your customers. Today’s customer expects fast, easy solutions and to feel understood and respected throughout the process.</p>",
    "<p>To meet these expectations, you’ll need clear procedures implemented in several key stages:</p>",
    "<ol>",
    "<li><strong>The company vision.</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Your vision should be built on the values your company represents—like transparency, courtesy, and integrity—and these values must be embedded in customer service. For example, if courtesy is a core value, make it a rule that after every call, the rep confirms the customer’s issue was fully resolved.</p>",
    "<p>A service values map will show you where you stand today and where you want to be. It can include data like average wait times, time to resolve issues, and more.</p>",
    "<p>From this vision, create a list of actions to improve and align service with your company values.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"2\">",
    "<li><strong>Call recording and monitoring.</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>To ensure your rules are followed consistently, you’ll need ongoing monitoring. Call recording is one of the best tools for this. It reveals the most common customer issues so you can fix them at the root—reducing pressure on your team and speeding up resolution.</p>",
    "<p>For example, if 5 out of 10 calls are about product setup, your instructions are unclear. Listening to calls helps you pinpoint the problem and update your guide accordingly. You might also create multiple support channels (videos, FAQs, chat) to address the same issue more efficiently.</p>",
    "<p>Another benefit of call recording is tracking how long it takes reps to resolve an issue. You can then shorten this time with better training, clearer processes, or giving reps more authority to make decisions.</p>",
    "<p><strong>Customer feedback.</strong></p>",
    "<p>Surveys are another critical tool. The two most useful are the CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score) and NPS (Net Promoter Score). These provide clear insights into what’s working and what’s not.</p>",
    "<p><strong>CSAT</strong> measures how satisfied customers are with your service. For example, a customer may be happy with the solution itself but unhappy with how long it took—two different insights that help you improve.</p>",
    "<p><strong>NPS</strong> shows how likely customers are to recommend your product or service to others. The higher your NPS, the more your service drives organic growth through word of mouth. Remember, satisfied customers tell an average of 8 others about you.</p>",
    "<ol start=\"3\">",
    "<li><strong>Empowering your service reps.</strong></li>",
    "</ol>",
    "<p>Great service means giving reps authority to make decisions during calls. This shortens resolution time, improves satisfaction, and boosts both CSAT and NPS. For example, allowing a rep to approve a product return or offer compensation on the spot makes a huge difference in the customer experience.</p>",
    "<p>Of course, you’ll need to balance this with profitability. Sometimes refunds or compensation may not make financial sense—but you should also weigh the long-term cost of refusing them.</p>",
    "<p><strong>In summary:</strong> To create outstanding customer service, start with your company vision and translate values into specific, measurable actions. Then, implement monitoring tools like call recordings and customer surveys to continuously improve. Finally, empower your reps with flexibility and authority to make customers happy in real time.</p>"
