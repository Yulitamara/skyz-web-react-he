  "<p>Before we begin comparing the three operating models of customer relationship management systems, let's briefly explain each one:</p>",
  "<p><b>Cloud CRM (customer relationship management in the cloud)</b> – a model in which you subscribe to a CRM service and the data is stored in the cloud.</p>",
  "<p><b>On-Premises CRM (customer relationship management installed on the organization’s servers)</b> – a model in which you purchase CRM software licenses and the database and data are installed on the company’s servers.</p>",
  "<p><b>Hybrid CRM (hybrid customer relationship management)</b> – a model in which you purchase or rent the CRM licenses but host it on third-party servers.</p>",
  "<p>To reach the right conclusions about which model best suits your organization, here are the advantages of each:</p>",
  "<p><b>Cloud CRM (cloud-based CRM)</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>Immediate connection to the system</li>",
  "<li>No need to procure and maintain the information system on a dedicated CRM server</li>",
  "<li>Lower upfront costs for expensive hardware and software licenses</li>",
  "<li>Recognized operating expense instead of depreciation</li>",
  "<li>Faster user rollout</li>",
  "<li>Maximum flexibility in adding/removing users (pay only for actual use)</li>",
  "<li>Work with a single specialist provider</li>",
  "<li>Better availability from anywhere, 24/7</li>",
  "<li>Multi-layered, high-level information security</li>",
  "<li>Automatic daily backups</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p><b>On-Premises CRM (CRM installed on the organization’s servers)</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>Leverage existing IT investments in the organization</li>",
  "<li>Direct management and control of the CRM database on the organization’s internal servers</li>",
  "<li>Full control over the pace of infrastructure upgrades and security</li>",
  "<li>Maintain full ownership of customer data, including control over the CRM upgrade timeline</li>",
  "<li>Adding licenses does not entail ongoing increases in monthly CRM costs</li>",
  "<li>Use in-house staff or selected outsourcing to manage IT resources (including</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>managing the CRM)</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>Less sensitivity to potential external connections</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p><b>Hybrid CRM (hybrid CRM)</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>Combines cloud CRM with capabilities of CRM&nbsp;installed on company servers</li>",
  "<li>Reduced overhead and expensive hardware procurement, similar to the cloud model</li>",
  "<li>Option to choose the type and provider of system hosting</li>",
  "<li>Avoid deploying CRM entirely in-house with all the associated complexity</li>",
  "<li>Cloud solution with the option for higher information security</li>",
  "<li>Secure, bidirectional data flow from the cloud to internal, purpose-built applications</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p><b>So which model is best for your company?</b></p>",
  "<p>The preferred operating model for a CRM system depends on your company’s specific needs now and in the foreseeable future.</p>",
  "<p><b>Choose CRM&nbsp;in the cloud if:</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>You need an immediate CRM solution for managing customers</li>",
  "<li>You prefer to work with a single vendor</li>",
  "<li>Your operations require availability and fast access from anywhere, 24/7</li>",
  "<li>Your organization lacks a skilled IT team (including outsourced) to support CRM professionally</li>",
  "<li>You want to move cautiously toward a customer-management solution without large investments in an internal setup that might fail (and there have been plenty of such cases…)</li>",
  "<li>You want a customer-management solution that scales flexibly with the organization as needed</li>",
  "<li>You don’t have robust information-security systems or a disaster-recovery plan for the CRM</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p><b>Choose on-premises CRM if:</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>The organization is legally or regulatorily required to host its data or keep it within a specific jurisdiction.</li>",
  "<li>There’s a need to integrate with complex local systems with large data volumes and applications with special procedures.</li>",
  "<li>You want to leverage existing in-house IT resources (personnel and infrastructure).</li>",
  "<li>Full ownership of the information system and flexibility for specific customizations are very important to you.</li>",
  "<li>Customer and company data are entirely confidential and the company avoids any engagement with third parties.</li>",
  "<li>The organization needs synchronization capabilities that let employees modify CRM data while offline.</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p><b>Choose hybrid CRM if:</b></p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li>You need a setup where some applications and services are provided from the cloud and the rest via your own computing resources</li>",
  "<li>Secure, bidirectional data flow from the cloud to internal, purpose-built applications is important to you</li>",
  "<li>The organization wants cloud CRM, but the security policy is very strict and requires choosing a specific hosting provider</li>",
  "<li>Local control is required over data that is too sensitive to be available in the cloud</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>To conclude, if we must give a clear, unambiguous answer, we would sum it up as follows:</p>",
  "<p><b>If your company has no special requirements for complex enterprise systems or applications that must integrate with the CRM, and you want to grow commercially with caution without risky investments—yet still benefit from an advanced, secure CRM that’s available 24/7 from anywhere—then the cloud CRM model is recommended.</b></p>"
