the \u201cwhere we want to go,\u201d defined by goals derived from the vision.</p>","<p>For example: we decided that one important target in our strategic plan is the city of Haifa.</p>","<p><b>Tactics</b> - the \u201chow the company will get there,\u201d i.e., the actions and maneuvers it will take to achieve the target.</p>","<p>Continuing the example: if strategically we chose to reach Haifa, tactically the question is how - by plane, by car, or by mountain bike.</p>","<p>Now, let\u2019s return to CRM:</p>","<p>In the past, before the cloud and mobile (smartphone) revolution, CRM systems played tactical roles such as outbound telemarketing, meeting scheduling, sales management, customer retention, follow-ups, and more. To illustrate the tactical nature, consider one core CRM use case: running outbound telemarketing.</p>","<p>Suppose a company decided that one of its key strategic goals is to win back customers who have churned over the past ten years. Tactically, the question becomes how to do it, and one option is to run outbound telemarketing using the CRM. This clearly shows CRM serving as an execution-level tactical tool that propels a strategic objective.</p>","<p>Now let\u2019s ask: how did CRM - once essentially a tactical tool - become, in the new era of cloud and smartphones, a first-class strategic tool?</p>","<p>The answer lies in the shift to cloud CRM and its mobile readiness, which vastly amplified CRM\u2019s capabilities and benefits. <b>The most fundamental improvement is the ability to update the system from anywhere, in real time.</b> In practice, the CRM becomes a massive internal knowledge base with analytics that can support - and even reshape - strategic moves.</p>","<p>Here\u2019s an example of how CRM influences strategic planning:</p>","<p>Assume field sales reps discover in a meaningful share of meetings that customers are interested in complementary solutions to the flagship product.

In this case, the product is a core organizational information system that requires investment in implementation and staff training, and in many cases it impacts company culture. Therefore, if we ask ourselves questions before buying much simpler products, all the more so before adopting a system with far-reaching implications\u2026</p>","<p>So, what questions should you ask yourselves before buying?</p>","<p>We recommend at least 10 basic key questions:</p>","<h2>1. Which needs should the CRM system address?</h2>","<p>Before investing in a customer relationship management system, make sure the needs you want to solve are crystal clear. A CRM won\u2019t be effective if it\u2019s used only as a data repository. The system offers a wide range of capabilities that can streamline sales, marketing, and service and take your business to new heights.</p>","<p>Consider which needs you want to cover:</p>","<ul><li>More efficient and organized work for the sales, marketing, and service teams?</li><li>Management from anywhere, in real time?</li><li>A single view of customer status?</li><li>Preventing knowledge loss when a team member leaves?</li><li>Better customer service?</li><li>More accurate tracking of activity with customers?</li><li>Customer retention, e.g., running customer clubs?</li><li>Proactive marketing, e.g., creating targeted email campaigns?</li><li>Building cumulative knowledge bases?</li><li>Information and file sharing?</li><li>Better insights into conversion rates, close rates, and product profitability?</li></ul>","<h2>2. Does the system fit your company\u2019s user teams and organizational culture?</h2>","<p>Every change, even a small one, requires forethought about its effect on employees and day-to-day operations - especially when it\u2019s a new CRM that will touch most daily processes. Before choosing a system, carefully examine how well the CRM fits your teams\u2019 work patterns and how it will integrate with your organizational culture.</p>","<h2>3. How long will it take the target team to get onboard and start working?</h2>","<p>This answer matters a lot, because a wrong decision can be costly. For an initial estimate that\u2019s as realistic as possible, consider three factors:</p>","<p><b>Solution complexity</b>  -  If you choose a heavily customized CRM with \u201cspecial tailoring,\u201d development, installation, and rollout can take many months. By contrast, purchasing an off-the-shelf CRM for the office can take days to weeks. In both cases the timeline depends on data import, company size, and number of users.</p>","<p><b>Operating model</b>  -  Compared with installing an on-premises CRM on your own servers (which is complex and time-consuming), a cloud CRM in a software-as-a-service model (without special customizations and complicated imports) can get you started within hours.</p>","<p><b>Implementation process</b>  -  This depends on the vendor\u2019s ability to implement and train, and on your users\u2019 willingness to learn. If you can create strong motivation to learn the system, the time to steady-state will shrink.</p>","<h2>4. Can the system integrate effectively with the company\u2019s existing and required applications?</h2>","<p>Remember: a CRM should streamline work and ease daily operations. Its integration with required apps is crucial. Emphasize easy input from external data sources, avoiding copy-and-paste overhead, solid integration with email clients such as Outlook, and connections to social platforms that are part of everyday work.</p>","<h2>5. What essential information do we need to get from the CRM?</h2>","<p>Before choosing a system, think through your information and reporting needs:</p>","<ul><li>Do you need forecasts at a high level or a granular one?</li><li>Should views differ for different roles in the company?</li><li>What level of granularity do you need in reports and dashboards - per specific steps or across the entire process?</li><li>Are there special display requirements that should be reflected across sales, marketing, and service?</li></ul>","<h2>6. How will sensitive information entered into the CRM be protected and secured?</h2>","<p>CRM security is critical for every organization. Broadly, you have two options:</p>","<p>A. Security handled and managed by you, assuming the solution resides in-house. In this case, the security level falls on your IT team (if you have one) or on an outsourced IT provider.</p>","<p>B. Security handled and managed by the system provider (for cloud CRM) or by a third party (for hybrid CRM - purchased from the software vendor but hosted on third-party servers). This option typically provides multi-layer, high-level security and is worth considering.</p>","<h2>7. How can the system cope with rapid growth and organizational changes?</h2>","<p>Startups, companies, and even large organizations often go through periods of rapid growth or change that require adding users - or, conversely, reducing headcount.</p>","<p>The question is how the CRM adapts to these changes. In many cases it\u2019s easier with a cloud CRM, which lets you add or remove subscriptions in minutes, compared with an on-premises CRM that demands extensive effort, additional hardware and costly equipment, and security for each added user.</p>","<h2>8. What financial risk are we taking on when purchasing the system?</h2>","<p>When you sign a CRM purchase order, you commit to an investment that may be substantial. Choosing between a cloud model and an on-premises model directly affects financial risk. On-premises involves a one-time investment that may pay off long-term, but if costs balloon or implementation fails, it can be risky. With the cloud model, you connect immediately, pay monthly per user, and your short-term risk is lower - with the option to disengage if things don\u2019t work out.</p>","<h2>9. Who is the CRM vendor and what service level will we get?</h2>","<p>For any product you should check the vendor and service level - doubly so for CRM. Know who the vendor is, their reputation, whether they also develop the CRM, and above all the support quality you\u2019ll receive. Unavailability during issues or questions can cause significant damage. Remember: the CRM is the main engine for managing day-to-day sales, marketing, and service processes.</p>","<h2>10. Which technology is the system built on?</h2>","<p>Technology today is dynamic and constantly evolving. Don\u2019t end up with an information system based on outdated tech that can\u2019t integrate with modern applications. Understand each system\u2019s technological pros and cons to assess implications for real-time work from anywhere (e.g., cloud), performance, and flexibility for changes and customizations.</p>","<p><b>In conclusion:</b></p>","<p><b>Before you purchase a CRM system, examine carefully and don\u2019t hesitate to question your assumptions. The right CRM choice will give you a major boost; the wrong choice can do the opposite and cause significant damage.</b></p>"]},{"id":"4","url":"\u05d0\u05d9\u05da-\u05dc\u05d1\u05d7\u05d5\u05df-\u05d5\u05dc\u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05da-\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1-\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8-\u05d4\u05e1\u05db\u05dd-\u05e8\u05de\u05ea-\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8-2","title":"How to Review and Draft a Better Service Level Agreement (SLA)?","img":"/blogs/blog-4.jpg","filters":["all","CRM","\u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05d7\u05ea \u05dc\u05e7\u05d5\u05d7","\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea"],"content":["<p>Service contracts with customers are an important and sensitive topic that require serious attention from any organization that provides services to the public. This article offers insights for reviewing and drafting an effective Service Level Agreement (SLA) tailored to the customer\u2019s needs. We\u2019ll briefly define what an SLA is, present the key components of a solid service charter, and conclude with practical recommendations for writing a better SLA.</p>","<h2>What is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?</h2>","<p>A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is the part of a contract that defines which services the provider will deliver and the required level for each one. Service levels focus on classic attributes organizations are expected to provide, such as availability, operating and downtime hours, ticket handling times, outputs, response times, turnaround times, and failure conditions. These attributes require precise measurement mechanisms that include quantitative metrics, units of measure, measurement cadence and periods, as well as how results will be reported to the customer.</p>","<h2>What are the essential components of an effective SLA?</h2>","<h2>Defining objectives</h2>","<p>First and foremost, an SLA should state the goal of the service: Is the aim performance improvement? Cost reduction? Access to (technological) skills not available in-house? Are there multiple goals and, if so, which is the most important? Clarifying the primary objective helps focus the agreement on the elements that truly serve the need.</p>","<h2>Detailed description of the service</h2>","<p>The SLA should include a detailed description: What is the service? Where is it delivered? What are the service hours (including uptime/downtime)? Who is it for and when is it required? For example, if the service includes sending a report, the description should define the report\u2019s purpose, template, delivery method (email, fax, post), and frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).</p>","<h2>Performance standards</h2>","<p>The SLA must specify the expected performance standards. Customers tend to prefer higher standards - yet those can be costly or impractical; providers may prefer standards that are too low just to ensure compliance. This calls for balance and consideration of the following factors:</p>","<p><b>Type of service</b> \u2013 What service is in scope? What standards are customary in this domain?</p>","<p><b>Service availability</b> \u2013 What availability is required? Is the service online and requires rapid response, or is moderate availability sufficient?</p>","<p><b>Load dynamics</b> \u2013 Are significant load variations expected during the contract term, and how are they reflected in the standards?</p>","<h2>Measurement mechanisms</h2>","<p>An SLA requires precise, ongoing measurement of service levels throughout the contract term, including a metric catalog, clear definitions, and quantitative thresholds. A Service CRM can help with SLA templates, formulas, and mechanisms to calculate service-level scores at both granular and overall levels.</p>","<h2>Compensation as incentives</h2>","<p>It\u2019s advisable for the SLA to include a fair policy for credits and incentives. If the provider fails to meet the agreed standards, they should credit the customer a pre-defined amount - as a motivation to improve performance. Credits can be calculated in various ways, for example:</p>","<ol><li>Credit when service level drops below a specific percentage (e.g., 90%), with tiered thresholds that trigger different credits.</li><li>Credit based on the number of failures within a defined period.</li></ol>","<p>The key is that the credit policy genuinely incentivizes the provider to restore service to the agreed standard and achieve customer satisfaction.</p>","<h2>Critical failure</h2>","<p>Credits help improve performance, but what happens when there is a critical failure for the customer and the service becomes intolerable? It\u2019s important to include a material-breach clause.</p>","<p>What should this clause include?</p>","<p>A definition of what constitutes a critical failure - i.e., when the service becomes unacceptable - and the customer\u2019s rights in such a case, such as immediate termination, predefined compensation, and/or claims for damages.</p>","<p>Here too, measurement can be percentage-based or by counting the number of material failures within a defined period.</p>","<h2>Pricing changes</h2>","<p>Pricing adjustments during the contract should be addressed. Although a price is set in advance, sometimes updates are necessary due to internal or external changes. For example, if the service relies on an energy source whose price spikes unexpectedly, customers may need to absorb part of the cost.</p>","<p>It\u2019s recommended to include a clause that precisely defines the formula for adjusting the customer\u2019s price due to material factors - either overall or per factor.</p>","<h2>End-to-end service governance</h2>","<p>A key SLA component is the ability to perform continuous, holistic governance of service levels - goal attainment, performance standards, failures, credits, and changes. The provider should ideally use a Service CRM. A cloud-based solution enables the customer to view and monitor service processes, levels, and history from anywhere in real time.</p>","<h2>Recommendations and summary</h2>","<ol><li>Be involved in drafting the service contract and tailor it to your needs.</li><li>Don\u2019t let the SLA become a non-measurable marketing document - demand a purely operational agreement that covers the essentials.</li><li>Avoid last-minute pressure when preparing the contract.</li><li>Acknowledge there\u2019s no absolute perfection: insist on what really matters and build a win-win relationship with the provider.</li><li>Emphasize an incentive framework for meeting targets - it pays off.</li><li>Include a termination clause for material service failure.</li><li>Prefer providers with service-management systems (ideally cloud-based) for transparency and accurate long-term oversight.</li><li>Stick to the predefined service objectives - don\u2019t drift to non-relevant goals.</li><li>Measure service levels at short intervals (ideally with dedicated systems) to maintain high quality over time.</li></ol>"]},{"id":"5","url":"\u05d0\u05d9\u05da-\u05ea\u05e0\u05d4\u05dc\u05d5-\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea-\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d4-\u05d5\u05e0\u05db\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4-\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8-\u05e9\u05dc-2","title":"How to Manage a Smarter, More Effective Upsell & Cross-sell Strategy?","img":"/blogs/blog-5.jpg","filters":["all","CRM","\u05de\u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea"],"content":["<p>The early use of upsell and cross-sell techniques goes back many years - think of the falafel stand offering a variety of add-ons (salad, fries, etc.).

Involve the sales team in shaping the concept and prizes. Give both new and veteran reps a sense of ownership and make competitions part of your organizational culture.</p>","<h2>Keep competitors regularly updated</h2>","<p>Throughout the contest, keep reps informed about their standing. When people don\u2019t get updates, they lose interest and disengage - undermining the contest\u2019s value. You can share updates via your organizational CRM&nbsp;system, in a weekly team meeting, or in any creative format that boosts motivation to sell.</p>","<h2>Enable performance analysis - ideally with Cloud CRM</h2>","<p>Competitions spark reps\u2019 motivation to improve. Giving them visibility into their sales process and the ability to analyze it will help them generate insights and adjust for better results. A cloud-based CRM is exactly what they need: quick views of pipelines, smart reports from anywhere, in real time, to analyze status and elevate performance.</p>","<h2>Honor your commitments</h2>","<p>Stick to what you promised regarding rules and prizes. Don\u2019t promise rewards you can\u2019t deliver. Breaking promises destroys trust, tanks motivation, and in extreme cases can even trigger legal issues that hurt your brand - doing the exact opposite of what the contest intended.</p>","<h2>Award prizes without delays</h2>","<p>Prizes should be awarded on time - just like trophies after a sports final. Delays signal a lack of seriousness and even disrespect. Real, timely prizes build credibility and energize reps for the next competition.</p>","<h2>Don\u2019t overdo the number of competitions</h2>","<p>While competitions should become part of your culture, pace them sensibly. As with many initiatives, excess leads to fatigue. Too many contests can wear people out and dull the excitement. It\u2019s good to keep a bit of &quot;hunger&quot; for the next one.</p>","<p>Keep a finger on the pulse and listen to your reps</p>","<p>Internal competitions can boost motivation, but they can also create tension or negative energy. Keep an eye on what\u2019s happening (e.g., internal politics, someone feeling slighted, or other dynamics) and sense the overall mood. If you feel the contest is crossing lines or causing issues, step in, call a meeting, and reset it to its proper place - as a unifying, performance-boosting experience.</p>","<h2>In summary:</h2>","<p>A sales competition is a valuable initiative to include in your strategic plan. Emphasize simplicity, a fun atmosphere, frequent updates, keeping promises, and on-time prizes. Give reps tools to improve via smart, cloud-CRM reports. Also, avoid overdoing contests and stay tuned to office dynamics to keep the impact consistently positive.</p>"]},{"id":"7","url":"\u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05e2-\u05dc\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05e9-\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea-crm-\u05de\u05d9\u05d3-\u05e2\u05dd-\u05d4\u05e7\u05de\u05ea-\u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4-2","title":"Why Purchase a CRM System Immediately When Launching Your Company?","img":"/blogs/blog-7.jpg","filters":["all","CRM","\u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05d7\u05ea \u05dc\u05e7\u05d5\u05d7","\u05de\u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea","\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05e7","\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea"],"content":["<p>Founding a new company involves considerable costs-especially when the founders are investing their own money to cover the initial outlay.

At the beginning we can work with spreadsheets, and once we reach a significant number of customers, we\u2019ll choose a tailored system.&quot;</p>","<p>As someone who has accompanied startups, small businesses, and more established companies, this scene is familiar-not only at the inception of a new venture, but also in mature organizations that have never changed how they operate.</p>","<p>I\u2019ve always disagreed with postponing the purchase of a CRM. Now, with shifting trends in the modern era, there are in my view more than enough reasons to convince you to implement a CRM the moment the company is founded:</p>","<h2>Efficient management from day one</h2>","<p>Managing with a CRM prevents cumbersome file and spreadsheet juggling and improves workflows through advanced automation. The system enables orderly capture of incoming leads, sales-rep tracking from anywhere, process control including smart reporting, and customer retention mechanisms. Together, these provide a central lever to streamline sales and drive business success-especially at the critical early stage.</p>","<h2>SaaS model-goodbye upfront investments</h2>","<p>The rise of cloud-based CRM changes the rules of the game regarding large upfront investments in a customer-management solution. With on-premises CRM you face high initial costs for hardware and software. In a SaaS model, those costs don\u2019t exist: you connect quickly to an advanced cloud system for a relatively low monthly fee (as a function of the number of users), allowing any new business to get started without hesitation.</p>","<h2>Instilling the right habits from the start</h2>","<p>Changing existing habits is never easy-especially in companies and organizations. <b>It\u2019s strongly recommended to instill efficient, healthy habits from day zero-particularly with a CRM that will have a major impact on the long-term operational efficiency of your sales and marketing teams.</b> Solid discipline and an organized work culture from the outset will improve early growth metrics and reduce delays and disruptions caused by later course corrections.</p>","<h2>Building relationships with first-generation customers</h2>","<p>Your first-generation customers are the company\u2019s earliest and most valuable clients. Developing a positive relationship with them is key to future success, because they become your flagship customers and most important advocates. Trying to maintain these relationships via spreadsheets is cumbersome to the point of being unworkable. A smart CRM, by contrast, lets you analyze customer attributes, tailor responses to needs, and run retention initiatives such as customer clubs and newsletters.</p>","<h2>A dynamic marketing data repository with historical depth</h2>","<p>CRM systems-especially those based on cloud technology-have become dynamic data repositories that are crucial to marketing and sales effectiveness. There\u2019s no substitute for your sales team\u2019s ability to learn in real time from accumulated information about past interactions and processes.

A process this critical must be managed properly, as it can transform business results end to end.</p>","<p>In this article, I\u2019ll focus on the challenges of lead management and present the best ways to address them in light of shifting trends and work patterns in the modern era.</p>","<h2>What is lead management?</h2>","<p>Lead management is the process of tracking and handling inquiries from potential customers. It typically includes the following components:</p>","<p><strong>Creation:</strong> Capturing leads generated by a variety of tactical marketing activities that create interest and drive inbound inquiries-phone outreach, advertising, email campaigns, social media, PR, trade shows, conferences, and in-person meetings.</p>","<p><strong>Qualification & ranking:</strong> Classifying leads by type, level of intent, and their likelihood of becoming paying customers.</p>","<p><strong>Routing & first contact:</strong> Assigning leads to the right sales representatives for outreach and ongoing follow-up.</p>","<p><strong>Nurturing:</strong> Managing leads through scheduled follow-ups over time, enrolling them in targeted campaigns, or handing them to sales reps for follow-up-all to move them through the funnel toward conversion and long-term retention.</p>","<h2>What are the challenges in lead management?</h2>","<h3><strong>Operational complexity (large lead volumes)</strong></h3>","<p>Handling a few dozen leads is fundamentally different from managing hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands. Even small volumes aren\u2019t trivial; at scale it becomes truly complex. Beyond intake, qualification, routing, and follow-up, you must also consider those who convert to customers and must be continuously nurtured and retained. In short: long processes that demand serious management.</p>","<h3><strong>Filtering out competitor inquiries</strong></h3>","<p>A non-trivial portion of inbound inquiries come from competitors seeking information about new products, observing your sales operations, or learning your business models and workflows. A key challenge is to identify and filter out such leads early to prevent sensitive information from leaking.</p>","<h3><strong>Eliminating low-value leads</strong></h3>","<p>One of the most important tasks in managing inbound is filtering out trivial or low-value leads. This stream of noise clogs follow-up processes, wastes sales reps\u2019 time, and materially reduces conversion rates from lead to closed-won. Streamlining this step significantly improves sales effectiveness and ROI.</p>","<h3><strong>Smart assessment of lead potential</strong></h3>","<p>Even after removing low-value leads, you should rank the remaining ones by \u201cprobability to close\u201d and route them to the most suitable reps. This concentrates effort on the most promising leads, strikes while the iron is hot, and avoids losing time on complex, harder-to-close prospects.</p>","<h3><strong>Accurate process tracking</strong></h3>","<p>Lead management relies on sustained tracking from first touch through conversion. Misses or inaccuracies slow progress, create friction for reps, and often result in lost deals and missed new-customer acquisitions. Moreover, post-sale nurturing can suffer, risking churn among loyal customers.</p>","<h3><strong>Creating and managing leads in the field</strong></h3>","<p>Sales teams spend much of their time outside the office-at conferences, trade shows, on the way to meetings, or at customer sites. To operate efficiently, they need to capture and review lead status while on the go, so no opportunity is missed and the current picture is always clear.</p>","<h3><strong>Ongoing management oversight with minimal time</strong></h3>","<p>Another key element is managerial oversight of pipelines and sales reps. Weak oversight prevents a full, real-time view of lead status, bottlenecks, rep performance, and emerging trends.</p>","<h2>Which tool best tackles these challenges and boosts results?</h2>","<p>Given the challenges above, you need the right management tool to address them optimally. Today, the most effective option is a <strong><u>mobile-optimized cloud CRM</u></strong>. It delivers across all dimensions:</p>","<ol><li><strong>Advanced orchestration</strong> - A cloud CRM offers powerful capabilities for rapidly ingesting large lead volumes, managing long, complex processes with maximum efficiency, and accessing everything from anywhere. <strong>Result: far greater efficiency in lead handling, time savings, and a stronger top line.</strong></li><li><strong>Powerful qualification & scoring</strong> - Built-in filters and mechanisms identify and exclude unwanted or low-value inquiries. In addition, you can derive insights on lead quality by analyzing historical customer data across current and past deals. <strong>Result: excellent filtering and optimal prioritization of high-quality leads that convert.</strong></li><li><strong>Anytime, anywhere tracking</strong> - The combination of cloud technology and mobile readiness lets reps monitor and update lead status in real time from anywhere. <strong>Result: more accurate tracking and fewer missed opportunities.</strong></li><li><strong>Real-time managerial visibility</strong> - A cloud CRM provides managers with a live view of all open pipelines, promising opportunities, closed conversions, and rep activity driving leads forward. <strong>Result: real-time executive insights from lead creation through closed-won (including customer retention).</strong></li><li><strong>Information sharing</strong> - Cloud CRM enables real-time information sharing across the organization to help qualify, progress, and convert leads quickly and efficiently. <strong>Result: mission-critical information when it\u2019s needed, improving conversion rates.</strong></li><li><strong>Smart online reporting</strong> - Robust reporting is a cornerstone of CRM.

The ability to manage and support customers from anywhere, gain a real-time, full picture, track precisely, and derive insights from smart reports is vital for every customer-facing department. Yet above all departments, there is one for which CRM becomes more than important-it becomes a critical component and the X-factor behind success: <b>the Call Center.</b></p>","<p>A typical call center contends daily with tough challenges: heavy call volume, dissatisfied customers, constant firefighting, endless support, and complex issues. Improving efficiency in this organizational nerve center has an outsized impact on effectiveness, which elevates the importance of CRM to the call center\u2019s success.</p>","<p>Below is the unique contribution of a <b>cloud CRM</b> to elevating the organization\u2019s call center across key needs: <b>streamlining the center, a comprehensive customer view, faster work, real-time access, trend analysis, information sharing, accumulated knowledge, improved upsells and cross-sells, and stronger customer loyalty.</b></p>","<h2>Streamlining the phone center</h2>","<p>A cloud CRM integrated with a virtual PBX dramatically boosts call center effectiveness through three core advantages:</p>","<ul><li>Automatic call routing to specific sales or support reps anywhere, in real time-enabling exceptional flexibility and the right response for every customer.</li><li>The option to distribute the center across multiple locations-even different countries-without customers noticing, yielding significant cost savings.</li><li>Live operational metrics accessible from anywhere: number of inbound calls, average calls per hour, and similar indicators.</li></ul>","<h2>A 360-degree customer view</h2>","<p>Effective customer management in sales, marketing, or service requires rapid access to comprehensive information: details, history, current status, open tasks, and relevant reports. This is even more critical in the call center, which sits at the heart of incoming and outgoing interactions. A CRM that delivers a real-time, 360-degree view becomes a key factor in call center efficiency.</p>","<h2>Reducing call duration</h2>","<p>A fundamental KPI in any call center is the time it takes an agent to complete a call. Many factors influence call length, but one of the most important is how quickly agents can orient themselves to customer data and retrieve files or information that help identify needs and resolve issues. A cloud CRM\u2019s ability to surface essential information in real time markedly improves call center productivity.</p>","<h2>Faster workflow</h2>","<p>Slow business processes are a major barrier to call center effectiveness. They often stem from too many screens and clicks, cumbersome data entry, and poor alignment with user needs. Here a smart cloud CRM shines by:</p>","<ul><li>Providing fast access to information with minimal clicks.</li><li>Allowing friendly data entry and retrieval from anywhere-desktop or smartphone.</li><li>Improving understanding of needs and tailoring responses to each customer.</li></ul>","<p>Together, these advantages deliver a significant uplift in workflow speed and overall call center operations.</p>","<h2>Anywhere access, in real time</h2>","<p>A cloud CRM provides real-time access to all customer data from anywhere. This lets a specific agent who knows certain accounts respond effectively even outside the office-easily and efficiently, including from home. Linking a particular rep to a customer in real time saves valuable time, increases customer confidence, and positions the organization as a high-service brand.</p>","<h2>Analyzing accumulated data and spotting trends</h2>","<p>The volume of data a call center amasses via the CRM-history, traits, and customer needs-is enormous. This enables accurate analysis of future trends and yields insights for better handling of existing and potential customers. The CRM dashboard presents smart reports, graphs, and charts that support timely adjustments and better sales, service, and operational outcomes.</p>","<h2>Information sharing</h2>","<p>One of the key advantages of cloud CRM in the call center is the ability to share information across departments, agents, managers, and even external experts-from anywhere, in real time. This dramatically improves an agent\u2019s ability to receive inputs at critical moments from the right stakeholders, leading to faster, more professional resolutions.</p>","<h2>Improving upsells and cross-sells</h2>","<p>Analyzing existing customers\u2019 needs through a cloud CRM enables significantly deeper selling via upsells (upgrading the product currently in use) and cross-sells (complementary products). These moves can substantially increase call center revenue and customer satisfaction.</p>","<h2>Customer loyalty</h2>","<p>Another major-perhaps the most important-benefit of a cloud CRM is strengthening customer loyalty. The rich data collected, rapid responses, and accurate, effective answers reinforce relationships. Add to that a personalized experience enabled by high-resolution understanding of needs, and you have a winning formula for loyalty.</p>","<h2>In summary</h2>","<p>If you are setting up or upgrading your company\u2019s call center and want to focus on what truly drives success, start with the CRM that will power the team. Choosing the right cloud CRM can dramatically impact the call center\u2019s operational, managerial, marketing, and service performance; save significant time and money; improve customer experience; and foster a positive team atmosphere.

It\u2019s critical to consider any unique activities you must run through the system based on your business model.</p>","<h2>Look ahead</h2>","<p>Don\u2019t choose a solution only through the lens of \u201cwhat hurts today.\u201d Look forward and ensure the software fits future needs\u2014both at the micro level (internal organizational changes) and the macro level (external shifts in technology, competitors, customers, and suppliers).</p>","<h2>Assess the current state</h2>","<p>Your starting point matters. New companies start with a clean slate and mainly face choosing a system that fits their needs. Established companies often run legacy systems. The dilemma is whether to upgrade a familiar system or adopt a new one that will require onboarding and training and may affect organizational habits. Here too, the pace of change in your market and operations should be a dominant factor in your decision.</p>","<h2>Off-the-shelf vs. custom-built</h2>","<p>Ask yourselves: should you choose an off-the-shelf platform with light tailoring, or a fully custom solution? In most cases I favor an existing platform with sensible adjustments to your requirements. You may compromise slightly on a \u201cperfect fit,\u201d but you benefit from other firms\u2019 accumulated experience, save substantial development costs, receive vendor upgrades and updates, and avoid dependency on a single custom developer. Of course, in complex cases, a bespoke solution\u2014with all its costs\u2014may be the right choice.</p>","<h2>Cloud technology (SaaS model)</h2>","<p>Pay close attention to the global shift toward cloud technology and Software as a Service. This trend changes the rules across management, financial, and operational dimensions:</p>","<ol><li>Manage the business from anywhere, anytime\u2014including on mobile.</li><li>Save on expensive hardware purchases.</li><li>Connect to the system immediately, without delays.</li><li>Benefit from high-level information security.</li><li>Gain flexibility and scalability that match your company\u2019s growth.</li></ol>","<p>While a client-server setup keeps management data fully under your control, the advantages of the cloud\u2014and its accelerating global adoption\u2014offer a compelling alternative with significant added value.</p>","<h2>CRM system</h2>","<p>This point is critical and too often overlooked. Business management software is frequently perceived mainly as a financial system, so customer relationship management across marketing, sales, and service gets less attention. Remember: financials are the backbone, but <b>CRM is the growth engine</b>\u2014for acquiring customers, retaining them, and closing deals. Don\u2019t compromise on the quality and effectiveness of the CRM component in the solution you choose.</p>","<h2>In summary</h2>","<p><b>When selecting business management software, don\u2019t be swept into a decision by a single, momentary pain point.

What they all have in common is that each set of contact details represents sales potential.</p>","<p>&nbsp;</p>","<h2>What are sales opportunities?</h2>","<p>Sales opportunities are essentially more qualified, more effective leads. In other words, opportunities also represent potential deals, but this potential meets specific criteria that indicate a higher probability of closing.</p>","<p>This is where differences between companies and industries appear.

The CRM lets reps view the action history and receive automatic reminders to call back. A cloud-based CRM is recommended so the entire follow-up process can be managed from anywhere, in real time.</p>","<h2>Value-added follow-up</h2>","<p>Don\u2019t follow up \u201cjust because.\u201d Reference a point, insight, or agreement from the previous conversation. Decision-makers are swamped, so reconnect them to the prior discussion as quickly as possible to move the lead another step toward becoming an opportunity and, ultimately, a closed deal.</p>","<h2>Use multiple contact channels</h2>","<p>Today you can reach customers via many channels: phone calls, emails, text/WhatsApp messages, chat, and social networks. Make your follow-up flexible based on the customer\u2019s preferences and habits. At minimum, use calls and emails\u2014but exercise judgment about when each is appropriate. For example, if the customer is constantly in meetings, don\u2019t interrupt with a call; send a concise, actionable email instead. Conversely, sometimes email can\u2019t replace a conversation\u2014find a calm time and call. Also, leverage social platforms where relevant; many customers interact there daily, and it can help you move the process forward.</p>","<h2>Reinforce key points</h2>","<p>Have reps reiterate the agreements and understandings reached during follow-up calls and in follow-up emails. Repetition creates clarity and commitment\u2014exactly what you want as you progress toward the \u201cclose.\u201d Smartly restate the product\u2019s or service\u2019s value for the customer to strengthen their conviction in the deal\u2019s importance.</p>","<h2>Share a call summary with the customer</h2>","<p>After each follow-up call, the rep should summarize the key takeaways directly in the CRM\u2014and send that summary by email to the customer, requesting acknowledgment. This helps maintain a positive cadence before the next touch and keeps the customer engaged.</p>","<h2>Set a next-step action plan</h2>","<p>End every follow-up call by prompting the customer toward a concrete next step. That step should advance the deal: clarifying a component, scheduling another meeting, a demo, a formal quote, or another clear call to action. A call without a defined \u201cnext step\u201d kills momentum and can stall the entire process.</p>","<h2>Learn from past cases (archives)</h2>","<p>A well-maintained CRM\u2014especially a cloud-based one\u2014becomes a high-value knowledge base.

Paradoxically, bringing up budget early has a double benefit:</p>","<ul><li>The price (i.e., the budget) becomes a legitimate, important selling point\u2014framed as an advantage\u2014rather than a last-minute figure that feels like a burden or a cost.</li><li>If there truly is no budget for any relevant reason, both sides save valuable time.</li></ul>","<h2>Reiterate the economic effectiveness of the deal</h2>","<p>Even if the prospect has accepted the price, it\u2019s smart to reiterate the financial logic\u2014how much they\u2019ll save by purchasing. If it hasn\u2019t sunk in yet, repetition helps it \u201cclick.\u201d If it has, repetition strengthens confidence on the way to a close.</p>","<h2>Adopt a smart pricing strategy</h2>","<p>You can\u2019t separate budget from pricing strategy. To overcome the \u201cno budget\u201d objection, offer a price range (from lower to higher tiers) that gives reps flexibility.</p>","<p>For example, if you quoted price X and the prospect objects on budget grounds, keep the option to provide a leaner package at a lower cost that fits their means (some truly can\u2019t spend more). Conversely, the range lets you capture higher budgets from buyers who want the most advanced, premium options.</p>","<h2>Signal that prospects with zero budget aren\u2019t a fit</h2>","<p>Prospects should understand from the start: if there\u2019s absolutely no budget, it\u2019s not a good use of time. Communicated intelligently, this helps in two ways:</p>","<ul><li>People don\u2019t like being perceived as lacking means, so they\u2019ll pivot to other objections\u2014letting the rep clear this hurdle early.</li><li>It rightly conveys that the solution has real value and a price.

You can overcome it by: quantifying the problem\u2019s cost vs. the solution\u2019s price; making budget a legitimate selling point raised early; offering a flexible price range as part of a smart pricing strategy; and signaling that zero-budget prospects aren\u2019t a fit\u2014because the product delivers substantial value.</p>"]},{"id":"15","url":"\u05d4\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8-\u05d4\u05d1\u05d0-\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9-\u05de\u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea-\u05d5\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05e7-\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea-\u05d4\u05e6","title":"The Next Step After Sales and Marketing: \u201cBuilding Customer Success\u201d!","img":"/blogs/blog-15.jpg","filters":["all","CRM","\u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05d7\u05ea \u05dc\u05e7\u05d5\u05d7","\u05de\u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea","\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05e7","\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea"],"content":["<p>We\u2019re used to thinking that the main engines of growth for boosting revenue and profit are sales and marketing.

This step increases revenue, strengthens cash flow, and adds significant credibility to your brand (as a company that works with the industry\u2019s big players).</p>","<p>So far, that\u2019s widely agreed. The real question is: how can a startup or small business actually make this leap?</p>","<p>Below are actions that will help you, as a small business, achieve that crucial progression of winning large strategic customers:</p>","<h2>Public Relations</h2>","<p>Invest in targeted PR and use today\u2019s rich content arsenal wisely: press releases, social networks, professional articles, and blogs. For example, if your startup operates in the construction sector, identify the relevant trade journals and outlets, send newsworthy press releases, publish expert articles that build your reputation, and leverage social media to reach the right professional groups.</p>","<h2>Partner with Complementary Vendors</h2>","<p>Create business collaborations with complementary suppliers who already work with the strategic account you\u2019re targeting. You can enlist these partners to promote your product\u2014or take a bolder step and offer bundled packages that combine both complementary solutions. Either approach can creatively get your foot in the door.</p>","<h2>Map the Decision Landscape and Key Relationships</h2>","<p>Once you identify a potential strategic account, study its span of control and internal relationship map. Understand whom to approach, who the decision-makers are, how decisions are made, and what the optimal sales path looks like to maximize your chances of closing. A smart CRM makes it much easier to surface these insights.</p>","<h2>Run Deep Processes with a Smart CRM (Preferably Cloud-Based)</h2>","<p>Leverage your CRM\u2019s relationship data and accumulated knowledge to pave the way toward winning the strategic customer. We strongly recommend a cloud CRM like Skyz, which provides a single view of interactions with all contacts, a map of internal and external relationships (suppliers, consultants, etc.), and access to a growing knowledge base relevant to the account. Selling to large strategic customers requires deep processes: precise tracking, timely updates, and instant retrieval of information from anywhere in real time\u2014exactly what a cloud CRM delivers best.</p>","<h2>Turn Contacts into Your Internal Champions</h2>","<p>The initial contacts you engage in a large organization play a much bigger role than in SMB deals. They\u2019ll need to pass information upward. Make them genuine supporters who believe in you enough to act as internal sales champions. They understand the organization\u2019s dynamics better than you do, and can materially advance the deal up the hierarchy.</p>","<h2>Schedule In-Person Meetings at Key Junctions</h2>","<p>Long sales cycles require human touch\u2014especially at pivotal moments. When you identify influencers who can sway decision-makers or creatively move the deal forward, don\u2019t skip a face-to-face meeting. Many companies avoid travel and prefer only phone or email follow-ups, but in these cases an in-person meeting builds stronger rapport with key stakeholders and often proves decisive in winning the strategic account.</p>","<h2>Showcase Your Small-Business Advantages</h2>","<p>On paper, a small business might seem disadvantaged versus larger competitors\u2014but not necessarily. You have unique strengths: highly personal, family-style service; greater flexibility; and often advantages in product innovation, pricing, or commercial models. Make sure your target account clearly sees those benefits.</p>","<h2>In Conclusion</h2>","<p>To level up and start working with large strategic customers, take smart steps: targeted PR; partnerships with complementary vendors (including joint bundles); mapping the decision landscape and relationships; managing deep processes via CRM; cultivating contacts into internal champions; holding in-person meetings at critical points; and highlighting your small-business advantages. Combining these actions will significantly increase your chances of winning a strategic account and mark a major growth milestone for your business.</p>"]},{"id":"17","url":"\u05ea\u05e4\u05d9\u05e1\u05ea-\u05dc\u05e7\u05d5\u05d7-\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1\u05d4-\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8-\u05de\u05de\u05d4-\u05e9\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05dd","title":"Customer Perception - Much More Than You Thought!","img":"/blogs/blog-17.jpg","filters":["all","CRM","\u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05d7\u05ea \u05dc\u05e7\u05d5\u05d7","\u05de\u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea","\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05e7","\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea"],"content":["<p>Every business deals with \u201ccustomer perception\u201d from day one.

In other words, customers observe, learn, interact with your company\u2019s representatives, form internal conclusions about your business and products, and build a mental image\u2014this is the customer\u2019s perception of your brand. Customer perception has always existed, but in today\u2019s era it has taken on new importance.</p>","<h2>Why has customer perception become so important right now?</h2>","<p>The internet revolution\u2014sharing and instant access to information from anywhere\u2014has reshaped business behavior. A prospective customer can easily, with virtually no friction, gather comprehensive information about the product they plan to buy, compare competitors and prices, read diverse reviews, and brainstorm in real time on social networks. This changes the rules of the game for how customers perceive a company and its products. <strong>All the information is already on the table!</strong></p>","<h3><strong>Let\u2019s illustrate with an example:</strong></h3>","<p>Suppose a shopper wants to buy a certain product and, like many others, aims to make the optimal purchase. After a quick web search (which wasn\u2019t possible years ago), they discover that a product from Company X is much cheaper than similar items from Companies Y and Z. Theoretically, if price were the only factor, they would rush to buy from X. However, this is where perception comes in. If Company Y has built a reputation as highly trustworthy, stable, service-oriented, and quality-focused, that perception can persuade the buyer to purchase from Y\u2014even at a higher price.</p>","<p>By contrast, twenty years ago the same shopper had far less access to information about companies and pricing. Purchases leaned more on \u201cthe first good deal that showed up\u201d and on the persuasiveness of whichever salesperson happened to call.</p>","<h2>So what should you do to improve customer perception in the new era?</h2>","<p>The key drivers of customer perception include advertising, the people who influence the buyer, social networks, consumer reviews and price-comparison sites, and\u2014above all\u2014the buyer\u2019s direct experience with your company and products (sales interactions, product usage, and service). Each company should analyze which factors are most relevant in its market and initiate tactical steps to improve perception.</p>","<p>Below are general initiatives that can each materially improve customer perception. Implementing some\u2014or all\u2014will help you succeed.</p>","<h3><strong>Truth in advertising</strong></h3>","<p>Advertise only what\u2019s true about your products. Don\u2019t exaggerate just to impress. Once customers spot gaps between your claims and reality, they\u2019ll label the company and its products as untrustworthy\u2014and that spreads quickly (especially in today\u2019s sharing culture).</p>","<h3><strong>A positive, optimistic stance toward customer success</strong></h3>","<p>People gravitate toward upbeat people; the same is true in business. Customers will perceive your brand far more positively if your team projects optimism and a genuine belief that your product advances the customer\u2019s success. Expressing the human side helps\u2014both your customers and your company benefit.</p>","<h3><strong>Genuine listening to needs</strong></h3>","<p>Truly <u>listen</u> to the customer\u2019s needs. Too often, reps and managers push only from their angle, which doesn\u2019t help. Real listening and empathy for the customer\u2019s actual problems create a perception of caring\u2014not just a desire to sell at any cost. Moreover, if you know a product isn\u2019t right for a customer (even if it\u2019s your most profitable), don\u2019t sell it. Offer what genuinely fits. That dramatically elevates your brand perception.</p>","<h3><strong>Deep domain expertise</strong></h3>","<p>Invest in mastering your field and demonstrate professional command. Customers are savvy enough to sense your true expertise. Projecting uncertainty or shallow knowledge erodes confidence and can cause lasting damage.</p>","<h3><strong>Customer retention via CRM</strong></h3>","<p>Your existing customers are your most important ambassadors\u2014invest in keeping them. Manage all interactions through a smart CRM that supports retention plays like loyalty clubs, up-sells and cross-sells that genuinely help customers succeed, newsletters, and personalized messages (birthdays, holidays, and more).</p>","<h3><strong>Smart, targeted use of social networks</strong></h3>","<p>In the sharing era, social networks can massively amplify your image and customer perception.

Also, listen to feedback and reviews, engage in interactive conversations, and create a sense of closeness and care that modern customers value.</p>","<h3><strong>Make things simple for customers</strong></h3>","<p>Make it fast, easy, and straightforward to buy from you and get service: simplify the purchase flow, write clear service agreements, offer fair shipping/returns, ensure digital access (e-commerce), and present pricing transparently. Be simple and clear.</p>","<h2>In conclusion:</h2>","<p>Customer perception today is far more consequential than many assume.
